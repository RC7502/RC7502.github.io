A big Bitsmack congratulations (estimated value is 3 cents) goes out to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/10/23/music.yankovic.reut/index.html">Weird Al Yankovic for finally having a top ten album</a>.

It's been 23 years since he's released his first album, and although he's come close, this is the first one to crack the top ten. With pop culture so fractured nowadays, it must be tough for him to parody a song that enough people have heard. Even now, with <em>White & Nerdy</em>, I still run into people that have never heard the original, <em>Ridin' Dirty</em>.

BTW, you can download the parody of James Blunt's song <em>You're Beautiful</em>, called <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/"><em>You're Pitiful</em>, directly from Weird Al's website</a>.
