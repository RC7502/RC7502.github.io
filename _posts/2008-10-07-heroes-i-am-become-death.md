Heroes this week continues its streak of most WTFs per hour. Although I am starting to wonder if it might be better to go deeper on some story lines instead of jumping back and forth so much.

Spoilers and recap after the jump.

<strong>Peter and Peter's Excellent Adventure</strong>

Future Peter takes regular Peter four years in the future to show him how screwed up every thing is because of the super-serum that gives people powers. Except that it doesn't look screwed up at all. Stockbrokers drink coffees and fly to work and everything is good. Claire shows up and shoots the hell out of future Peter. Regular Peter gets away by hitting TheHatian in the face which I've wanted someone to do since season 1. Peter goes to Mr. Isaac's loft where Suresh aka The Lizard now hangs out. They don't show what he looks like which is kinda lame. Peter finds out he needs Sylar's vampire ability to stop the world from exploding. Nobody really bothers asking what his power really is or why it would help anything.

Peter finds Sylar, and surprise! Sylar is now a housewife. TWIST! He has a son Noah and he doesn't use his powers anymore. Peter convinces him the world is going to casplode and gets his power right before Claire's goon patrol shows up. Scarecrow crushes Sylar's kid which naturally causes Sylar to go nuclear. Seriously he explodes and it looks amazing. Peter is captured yet again and uses Sylar's abiity to start to kill Nathan and then teleport back home.

<strong>Parkman Fever</strong>

Parkman, aka Sean from Felicity as Ashley likes to call him, took the African man's drug and saw the future. In the future Parkman is married to Flashette and they have a kid, in addition to being Molly's guardian. Even those its supposed to be 4 years in the future Molly doesn't look any older. This is the opposite of Lost where no time has passed and Walt looks damn near 30. Flashette was part of Claire's goon patrol but didn't make it out in time during the explosion. Except that she did survive long enough to get back to Parkman and ruin his day.

<strong>She's Cold as Ice</strong>

Tracy talks to that doctor guy from last week and finds out he was basically doing the same thing as Suresh with giving people powers. After seeing a newspaper article about the reporter she killed ("believe it or not, I'm frozen to death, I never thought I'd break into pieeeces") now she feels bad about it. She quits Nathan and jumps off a bridge, which he just happened to be flying by. Best line of the episode:

Nathan: "you look upset"
Tracy "really? you would think I was in perfect mental health since I just tried to freaking KILL MYSELF!"

Nathan is still talking to his imanginary Linderman and making a difference by picking out a desk for his office. We find out he went with Kennedy's desk. Thank god they didn't drag this desk picking storyline out for the rest of the season.

<strong>Hiro and Ando have a Hissy Fit</strong>

Hiro and Ando are locked in Level 2 and after watching Die Hard too much decide to escape through a vent. Meanwhile they bitch at each other about how Hiro doesn't trust Ando just because Hiro saw Ando kill him in the future. Blah blah blah. Mama Petrelli shows up, explains some of the situation, and then Hiro and Ando are digging up a coffin. Surprise! It's Sark from Alias.
