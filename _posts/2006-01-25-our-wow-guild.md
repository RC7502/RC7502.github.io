Hi all,
Just wanted to say hello to all our new guildies as Bitsmack is now in open enrollment.  We're 50+ now but we need to be bigger!  Message any current guildy and they should have invite permission.  We are still trying to stay tight but we also need a larger mass.

Hit the tab at the top for forums.  We're going to be posting anything that's going on with the guild there.  On the right side we've got the downloads section where we'll be hosting the guild modset.  

Guild nite is thursday from 7pm-midnight EST.  I officially have that nite off work now so I can make it everytime :D  Vent server isn't posted but most of the officers should know it by now.  We will be using it for guild nite.

ENJOY!
K-dog out
