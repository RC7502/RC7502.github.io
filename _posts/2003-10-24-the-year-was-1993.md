Today's <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=347>"comic"</a> is completely real. A wise man once said, "those who forget the 90s are doomed to repeat them."
<br />

In other news, the entire Bitsmack gang and maybe a few <a href=http://www.devryguyz.com>DevryGuyz</a> will be at Easton Friday night for the release of the new version of OS X. Even if you don't own a Mac like me it's still fun to watch the people that will line up for this kind of thing. Forget going to a haunted house, cornfield or hoochie, for real scares come to the Apple Store Friday night at 8pm. BOO!<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031024.gif' alt'' />
