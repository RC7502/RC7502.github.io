There is a <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=84>comic</a> today.
<br />
<br />
Kruton and I had a busy weekend. We went to Defiance to play Para Para Paradise. It's an ok game. Then we went to a LAN party and played some Medal of Honor. Also, Kruton finally got a Beatmania controller and 5th style. I have to say that Beatmania is a really cool game. 
<br />

In other news, I'm stuck on a boss in Metroid Prime already. I know how to beat him but it is just hard. I also haven't been playing much XBOX Live lately. I'm getting tired of the demos and I haven't went out to buy Unreal Championship or MechAssult yet. Oh, and Bitsmack finally got it's 100th member! Woo Hoo!<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021125.gif'   />
