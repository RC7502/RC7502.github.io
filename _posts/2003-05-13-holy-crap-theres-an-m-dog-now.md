It is time I come clean with all of you. Back in the 1980s a secret branch of the government started the "-dog" project. Their mission was to genetically engineer children to be the ultimate Combat players. These children could then grow up to be the warriors of tomorrow er... today. K-Dog was the first successful test subject. However, the scientists didn't anticipate that games would be released that were better than Combat. The project was supposedly cancelled, but now this new M-Dog has emerged.

Does this mean the project continued, possibly with Super Battletank?
