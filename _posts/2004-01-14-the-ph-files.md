<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=376>Today's comic</a> is about video games. <i><b>STUNNED!</b></i>
<br />

<br />
<b>Game K-Dog got me talked into playing of the week</b>
<br />
<a href=http://www.interactivemusicexchange.com/>IMX</a> is like the stock market game except that you are buying and selling music artists. It is free to play and you can turn in your fake money for real prizes. If you get the Fuse network there is also a show that goes along with the game in some way. The game is fun in a "I don't really have to do much" kind of way. If you decide to play, post your screenname here so we can compare scores. My id is chill182 and K-Dog's is kruton6.
