Coming to a <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=310>store shelf</a> near you...

As I mentioned before I bought Knights of the Old Republic for xbox. Even after a week the game is still pretty cool. I am trying to become an evil Jedi but its not as simple as just picking the meanest thing to say every time. If you're mean to everyone they won't help you or give you stuff. My new strategy is to be civil until the opportunity arises to screw someone over.

In other news, I saw this band on The Screen Savers called <a href=http://www.minibosses.com>The Minibosses.</a> They play rock remixes of video game tunes. On the show they played Goonies II, Double Dragon, Punch Out and Contra. You can download mp3s of their music at the above link.

Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if everyone was like K-Dog? I imagine it to be something like this <a href=http://10kcommotion.com/>webcomic.</a> It's a shame when I see someone with artistic skills draw a comic with such a crappy story. Click on the above link if you dare peer into this alternate K-dogian reality.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030723.gif' alt'' />
