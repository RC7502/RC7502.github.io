Back in December of 2007, a simpler time for America, I bought an HD-DVD player on sale at Wal-Mart. There was a promotion to receive five free movies by mail. Granted they weren't the best choices but hey, free right? Here's the movies I chose:

Aeon Flux
The Hulk
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
The Frighteners
Darkman

Here are the movies I got:

Aeon Flux - This movie isn't bad actually.
Bulletproof - Otherwise known as "the Adam Sandler movie in the 90s I HAVEN'T seen".
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - I have seen the first Harry Potter once and don't remember it, I haven't read the books either.
Out of Sight - I haven't heard of this movie but it has George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.
Accepted - This was probably the best surprise of the bunch. It's a pretty good movie that's got Justin Long and Jonah Hill. It is also a combo format so it will play in a regular DVD as well.

I knew it would take a while to get my free HD-DVDs but I didn't imagine it would take longer than the existence of the format. Oh well, free is free.
