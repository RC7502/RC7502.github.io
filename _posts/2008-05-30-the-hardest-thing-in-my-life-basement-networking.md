When I first moved into my house and had two roommates our intranet was a horrific mess of cables running from the second floor down the stairs, through the living room, and then downstairs into the basement. If it's scariness could be contained in a SciFi movie it would be called "RJ Forty DIE." After my roommates moved out I decided to eliminate as as many cables as possible in my house so I moved my router to the living room and used wireless for the upstairs and the basement. The only problem is now I have my XBOX 360 in the basement for Rock Band and I have no way to get it on the network. Sure I could buy the special "360 wireless adapter" which last time I checked was 1 gillion dollars. Instead, I am forced to run a network cable down my basement stairs again.

The Hardest Thing In My Life is having to run a network cable to my basement for the 360.
