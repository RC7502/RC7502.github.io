Over the weekend I went to Buffalo, NY to visit Megan. We went and saw The Village Saturday afternoon. This is my favorite M. Night Shyamalan movie yet. It wasn't really as scary as we expected but if you liked The Sixth Sense and Signs you'll probably like this one. I can't really say anything more about the movie without giving away the ending.
