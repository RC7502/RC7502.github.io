So TechTV was bought out and is now merging with G4.  Hopefully we'll be getting a LOT better shows MORE often instead of the same 5 shows being run throughout the day.  I recently sat down and watched G4 this past weekend and can say portal is horrible, icons is cool, and Arena was neat.  I hope they don't kill any good shows.... Remember kids, we all lose out when things merge together :(
<br />

<br />
Anyways. The month of DDR tournies has ended. Turns out I'm actually looking more like upper material to even myself!  My scores have been getting a lot better in the arcade and I have to say if I get to play with awesome ppl I do in fact become slightly more awesomer.
