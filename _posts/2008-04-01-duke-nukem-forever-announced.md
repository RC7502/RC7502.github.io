The Id Family Enjoyment Company announced today that they are working on a follow up to wildly popular board game "The Duke of Nukem Travels to the Third Dimension." In this new game entitled "Duke Nukem Forever" you play as a royal duke of the fictional country Nukem. A Martian invasion has commenced in an unsavory neighborhood and only you and your Colt Peacemaker can dispatch them. Your adventure takes you through taverns and brothels as you lay waste to each and every little green man. When asked for a more definite release date, Id said it would hit stores "when it's done."
