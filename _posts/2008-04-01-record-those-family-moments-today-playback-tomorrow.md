Thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Scott" class="mw-redirect" title="Leon Scott">Edouard-Leon Scott</a>, it is now possible to record sounds onto paper using his phonautograph. Think of the possibilities. Record the latest piece by Scott Joplin or Stephen Foster. Your baby's first word. Although it is only possible to record now, it is hopeful that some day you'll be able to replay the recordings.

It may be possible to someday actually carry your music with you as you go about your daily chores: butter churning, cow milking, or reading the latest novel by Charles Dickens.
