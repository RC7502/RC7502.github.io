Hey Hey! I wuz sitting at the apartment thinking to myself, "Man I want to kill a few hours by doing things that never worked" so RC stuck in Xbox Live! Several hours later we were STILL trying to connect to the servers! Wow, what an age we live in!
<br />

<br />
The constant battle to get RC to buy a GC is coming to an end as the release of Mario Sunshine is coming out this weekend! I predict that by the end of next month he will have one. 
<br />

<br />
This weekend for me has lined up well with going to Columbus for DDR and the Apple unveiling for OS 10.2, a Saturday evening jam fest and moving into the dorms! My weekend is jam packed and that doesn't even include all the video games I'll be playing!!! But fear not kiddies I WILL be playing games! I brought on a big scare with that whole 48 hour drought of video games but I'm back in action!
<br />

<br />
So for a recap, no xbox for me, Mario Sunshine and Starfox demo's are INCREDIBLE, and this weekend is going to be one big party!
<br />

K-dog out
