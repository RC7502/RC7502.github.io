Saturday started off with a bang! It was the day of the big DDR tourney. I woke up, watched some Aqua Teen Hunger Force, drove to McDonalds for some break-lunch, and headed to the mall to get warmed up.
<br />

<br />
For the first round the top three seeds got a by, meaning me, Sal and Bill all didn't get a basic round. In my first round, the trick round, I was up against fellow DDRME member Brian, I lost the coin toss (like normal) and got first song. I choose "The Twist" and I don't remember what happened after that, although I did win.
<br />

<br />
In my second round I played Bill. I, once again, lost the coin toss and we played "Can't Stop Fallin in love (Speed K Mix)", "Orion .78 (amero mix i think)", and it all came down to the last song which I don't remember what it was, but I won.
<br />

<br />
For the third round I was up against my arch nemesis Sal for placement of either 1st or 2nd for the overall tourney. I pulled a fast one on Sal and rocked his face off using "Dive" and was up 31 PERFECTs!! Then he pulled out his best shot with "Matsurui Japan" which I had been practicing ;) and he only beat me by 20. It all came down to the random song, as picked by the arcade's manager Clint. He stopped on "Boom Boom Dollar (K.O.G.G3 Remix)" amd Sal beat me by 2 leaving me the victor!!
<br />

<br />
In the losers bracket I was either going to be up against Bill or Sal for the tourney. Bill took some noticable thought from my battle with Sal and chose "Dive" as well. Bill ended up stopping Sal's reign of terror and we battled it out for the final round.
<br />

<br />
The final round came down to 3 songs. "Can't Stop Fallin' In Love (Speed K Mix)" (I Chose), "Sana et en Moriette" (Bill Chose), and "Petite Love" (Mgr random)
<br />

<br />
Bill didn't know it but I had been practicing the Sana song at home on DDRMAX (American ver.) so I wasn't too far behind after that. I ended up winning with no losses and then the real fun began :)
<br />

<br />
Me, RC, Bill (Borf), Brittany, Brock (Rock), Ben, Jon, Aaron (Kwik), and Angie all went to Ben's house in Toledo and then decided to goto Pinball Pete's in Ann Arbor. Man it was a blast. we got up there at about 8:30pm and stayed till around 1am. Pinball Pete's has four DDR machines (2nd, 5th, 6th, and 7th), 4 Guitar Freaks machines (2nd, 4th, 5th, and 7th) a Drummania 3rd mix, a Para Para 1st mix, and a Gunmania (possibly the only one in America). So all of us DDR freaks are up in MI together at an aracde and it was one of the best nights I've ever had. We also had plenty of laughs at the Pizza place after we left Pinball Pete's and even more laughter on the ride home. I'll have more of the story later in the week. As for now I'm heading home b/c mom's coming back from AZ tonight.
