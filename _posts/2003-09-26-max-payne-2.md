I got my wish. I wanted Rockstar to make a Max Payne 2 and they are. It's being released this November. It's being made for the Xbox and the PC. If Max Payne 2 is like the original, it will be awesome.
<br />
For those of you who don't know what Max Payne is, it's a 3rd person shooter. The original had non stop action. But to survive you had to save often. You could have a variety of weapons and you healed yourself with painkillers.
<br />
It's not surprising that Max Payne is made by Rockstar. RockStar knows how to make good games. They also made the Grand Theft Auto games.
<br />
If you own a PC or Xbox, you might want Max Payne 2. You may also want the original. It now only costs twenty bucks.
<br />
I'm looking forward to playing Max Payne 2.
