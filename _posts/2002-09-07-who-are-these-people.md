If you are reading the comic for the first time you may wonder "Who are these people?" I have now added a  <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=characters>characters</a> page in order to explain who we are. 
<br />

<br />
I also added a new section on the right side called "RC is playing" that shows exactly what game I have in each system right now.
<br />

Updates galore! I added a download section to the site. So far all that is there is a little Visual Basic program I made for class. Stay tuned, I have some cool movies and stuff to put up this week. You must log in or register to download files.
