In order to embarrass myself into working out more I decided to post my ongoing progress while I am training for the Cincinnati Half Marathon. Here's my starting point:

Age: 29
Height: 5' 6"
Weight 157.4

I am going to compare the results GoWear Fit gives me to the information I was already getting from The Daily Plate. Since my GoWear Fit didn't arrive till noon, this first day isn't really a full day. According to the GoWear Fit software in order to lose 2 pounds per week I have to burn 1000 calories more than I consume every day. I entered my target calories consumed as 1800. For the time before I started wearing the device it estimated I burned 1 cal/min while sleeping and 1.3 cal/min while awake. The GoWear Fit keeps track of how many minutes you do moderate activity and how many minutes you do vigorous activity. I decided to play some Rock Band on drums last night and it registered as moderate activity.

Here are the results of the first day:

GoWear Fit:
Avg. Calories Consumed: 1800
Calories Burned: 1924
Result: under by 124

The Daily Plate:
Calorie Goal: 1179
Calories Consumed: 2206
Calories Burned by Exercise: 0
Result: over by 1027

So here is the first problem I see with GoWear Fit. I went way over on my diet goal and I didn't have any way to account for that in the software. The only option it gives you is to record your diet for three days (they recommend a weekday, friday and a weekend day). After the three days are recorded it calculates a daily average for you to hit. So if I go way over or under GoWear Fit is going to assume I ate 1800 calories every day.

My goal for tomorrow is to try to hit 1800 calories consumed and to run 3 miles in the morning before work.
