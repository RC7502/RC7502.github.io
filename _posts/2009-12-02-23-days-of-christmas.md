Here it is, my all time favorite Christmas movie. Christmas Vacation came out 20 years ago and yet no one has come even slightly close to making a Christmas movie this funny. 

<iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=bitsmack-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&m=amazon&f=ifr&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&asins=B000VBIGD6" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" align="left"></iframe>Christmas Vacation tells the story of the Griswold family who opens their house to all their in-laws for the holidays. Clark Griswold strives to have the greatest Christmas possible and everything goes wrong along the way. Chevy Chase hasn't always made the greatest career choices but this is a role he plays perfectly. His delivery and facial expressions make mediocre jokes outstanding. 

Now of course there are some things that can be nitpicked about this movie. How did they dig the tree out without any tools? And would that piece of ice really fly all the way through the neighbors window? Why couldn't Clark get out of the attic, and why would he sit on the door until the family came back? These are just my minor observations. 

Christmas Vacation should be owned by every person who celebrates Christmas and/or enjoys comedy. I give it a 5 out of 5.
