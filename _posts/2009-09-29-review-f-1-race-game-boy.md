All right I hated this game. It's a racing game where the screen is divided into three sections: your main view at the top, a map in one corner and your speed in the other corner. You have only two cars to choose from. One has a higher top speed and the other has more boost fuel. I picked the higher top speed because I never had a problem running out of fuel. In the main single player mode you have to complete races in different countries. The problem is you can only proceed if you get first place. I thought maybe I just needed to be more hardcore but the game is so strict if you make the slightest mistake the first place guy gets a mile ahead of you and there is no possible way to catch up. I eventually made it through the first race and got to the second one where it was even more excruciatingly hard and then I just gave up. It was not really fun at all. Now this was the first 4 player Game Boy game so maybe it would be more fun against 3 human opponents. But as a single player game I can't recommend this one at all.
