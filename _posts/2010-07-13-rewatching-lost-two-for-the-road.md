Previously on Lost, Ana Lucia show a guy in cold blood. Oh crap that means we have to sit through another Ana Lucia episode. Ben tries to kill Ana Lucia and I root for him.

On the island: Ana Lucia bones Sawyer to get a gun. 
Off the island: Ana Lucia accompanies Christian Shepherd on his trip to Australia. 

The cop car numbers in the flashback have the numbers on them. Also Ana Lucia hangs out with Christian Shepherd in a bar. I wonder if all the Lost characters will have a drink with him at some point in time. This is the first we find out Christian Shepherd has a daughter in Australia. Oh hey, this is the episode where Michael kills off Ana Lucia, YAY! 

Ashley's note: She didn't like that he killed Libby but she was glad to see Ana Lucia go.
