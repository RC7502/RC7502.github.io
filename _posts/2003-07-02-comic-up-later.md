Today's comic will be up later tonight when I get home from work. Last night the Devryguyz and myself went and saw T3. Here is my review.

<b>Movie Review: Terminator 3</b>
<br />
I went into this movie with low expectations because other than Arnold it was a whole new cast, and James Cameron didn't direct. That being said, the movie exceeded my expectations. 
<br />

<br />
In Terminator 3 they don't stray from the original formula. Two terminators are sent back, one to protect John Conner and one to destroy. The car chases are longer and the special effects are bigger. The best part of the movie is the end. I won't give it away but it took me off guard. 
<br />

<br />
The movie is not without its faults. When John Conner sees Arnold he asks "are you here to kill me?" Why would he think Arnold was going to kill him when he was John's protector in the T2? Maybe since a different actor is playing John he forgot everything that happened in the last movie. My other nitpick is about the new Terminator chic. She can apparently take over computerized devices with some kind of nanoprobes. However, I don't see how this would allow her to control cars. Cars do have computers but how can these nanoprobes move a stick shift or press a pedal? The lamest scene involves her taking over Arnold with her probes. I was hoping to see a rebirth of the original Terminator, but instead we get a slow, jittery, confused Arnold.
<br />

<br />
Overall Terminator 3 isn't anything new, but that isn't really a bad thing. If you are a fan of the previous movies you'll like this one.
