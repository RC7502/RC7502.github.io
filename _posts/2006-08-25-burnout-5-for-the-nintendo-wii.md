A <a href="http://www.wii-uk.net/forumz/viewtopic.php?t=282">screenshot from a German site alludes to Burnout 5 being availble for the Wii</a>.

A feature that would be cool in Burnout 5 would be the availablity to get out of the car ala GTA. That way, when someone runs into you, you can get out of the car and try to beat him up. Combine Burnout 5/GTA/Mortal Kombat, and you've got a cool game!
