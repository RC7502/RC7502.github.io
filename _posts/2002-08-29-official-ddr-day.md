Tommorrow marks Findlay Ohio's official DDR day with the cristening of our DDR machine back in Findlay after an almost 6 month drought! 
<br />

<br />
Our 3rd mix machine at the mall was taken from us around February of this year and hauled off to the Defiance mall's Namco run arcade "Pocket Change"
<br />
Soon after it's departure it was upgraded to a 5th mix machine and has been ever since. In Defiance's time, they had one (1) tournament co-host by <a href="http://www.redoctane.com">Redoctane</a>. Inside sources tell me that the machine will remain the same (2 token/3 songs) and hopefully we can get them to reset the high scores. (they were rigged at the tourney in Defiance, ppl didn't know how to set it up for free play, non-stop)
<br />

<br />
Now if you know me well, I will be arriving at the mall when my classes end at 2pm and RC will be showing later that night after work and we will both be there until close. DevilZukin and some other BiTsMaCkErS may be there as well. Come up if you're bored, it'll be lots of fun and hey, maybe I'll buy you a game!! ;)
