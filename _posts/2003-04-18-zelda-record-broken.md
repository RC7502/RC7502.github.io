According to this article at <a href=http://www.twingalaxies.com/cgi-perl/news_release_Mruczek_report_Legend_of_Zelda.pl>TwinGalaxies,</a> Michael Damiani has broken a record by beating The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past in 1 hour 57 minutes. It's a pretty interesting article because it gives you some insight into this community of people who try to beat games as quickly as possible.
