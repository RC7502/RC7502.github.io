Since I have Netflix there are times when I like to rent an old favorite movie that I don't already own. This week it was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V3H?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000065V3H">Can't Buy Me Love</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000065V3H" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> starring Patrick Dempsey. You may know him now a doctor on Grey's Anatomy (unless you are male) but back in 1987 he was a scrawny nerd. Or rather he plays a scrawny nerd who pays off the head cheerleader to date him for a month. In the 80s this wasn't considered prostitution. He gets to be popular but it goes to his head and trouble is sure to follow.

This is an enjoyable movie with funny lines throughout. Plus you get to see Seth Green as a kid, and a guy plays Enduro Racer in one scene, so there's that. I give it 3.5 out of 4 on this scale:

4 = own it
3 = rent it
2 = watch it on tv while doing other things
1 = watch it just to make fun of how terrible it is
0 = never watch under any circumstances no matter how curious you are
