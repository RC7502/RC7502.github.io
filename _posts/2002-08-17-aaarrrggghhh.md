It's Saturday, meaning I came home for the weekend. I'm on a new game the hopefully might last me a little bit longer than the last 2. Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction for Mac/PC. It's a great game if ya'll wanna check it out. I wuz going to goto the Allen Co. Fair to see if they had DDR but instead I got sick :( oh well, maybe my fair will have one. Until Monday
