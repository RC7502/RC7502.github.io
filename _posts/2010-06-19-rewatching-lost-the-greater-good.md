We open with like the worst ending of a first date ever. Sayid and Shannon returning to camp after Boone just died.

On the island: Sayid gets manipulated into killing Locke by Shannon
Off the island: Sayid gets manipulated into letting terrorist die for Nadia

We finally find out Locke is the one who knocked out Sayid several episodes ago. And Sayid finds out about the hatch from Locke. We're getting close to the end of the first season here. 

Ashley's note: Sayid has had a very messed up life.
