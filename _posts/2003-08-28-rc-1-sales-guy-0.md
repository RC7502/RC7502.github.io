A couple of weeks ago, a salesman came to my door. Curiousity or boredom caused me to answer. It was a guy my age selling magazine subscriptions. I admit that he was really friendly and I took a look at the list of magazines available. The only one that even moderately interested me was XBOX Nation. It was the same price as EGM which I already get, but at the time I didn't know it was bi-monthly. What a ripoff! Anyway, I started to write the guy a check and afterwards I felt pretty dumb for buying a magazine I didn't really want.

A couple of days ago I get an envelope in the mail that had my check in it. It turns out that when I wrote in the amount one of the digits was too heavily written and they suspected the check had been altered. Since they couldn't deposit the check I was saved! Score one for me! Now I don't recommend using this method in other situations as it would probably be some kind of check fraud. This will be covered further in my upcoming book "The Bitsmack Guide to Getting Arrested." From now on my new strategy is never answering the door ever. However, if the sales guy ever turns out to be a sales girl, then I'm screwed.
