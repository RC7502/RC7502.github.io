This episode opens on Sun's eye, a way more attractive eye than Jack or Locke. 

On the island: The group splits into a cave group and a beach group while Jin tries to kill Michael over a watch. 
Off the island: Jin and Sun got married and Jin used to be a really great guy until he wasn't. 

Survival tip: if you are a woman and being chased by bees it's a good idea to strip off all your clothes.

I think it's funny Jack guesses the clothing degraded over 40-50 years when we know it's been much longer than that. It's also really cool that we find out Sun can speak English because she was planning on leaving Jin in Sydney but couldn't follow through. 

Q9. What are the white and black rocks, and who are the dead people in the cave?
A9. The bodies are the woman who raised Jacob and the man in black, and the man in black.

Ashley's note: she thinks Jin is a dick
