I have great news. Rockstar games is releasing Grand theft auto 3 and Grand theft auto Vice City together in a combo pack for the PS2. The combo pack is only going to cost $39.99(This is the price at Electronics Boutique. I'm not sure how much other stores will charge). GTA 3 and GTA Vice City originally cost $50.00 each. You'll save sixty bucks.
<br />
This is a great deal. Two fantastic games at a fantastic price. These were two of the best games made for the PS2. You can't beat this deal. If you own a PS2 but not the GTA games, get this combo pack. At $39.99, they're practically giving it away.
<br />
I would however like to caution parents. These two games are rated Mature. They have lots of violence in them. They may not be appropriate for small children.
<br />
Don't pass up this combo pack.
