<blockquote>Top 10 video games of 2006
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nothing really surprising on the list, except for the juggernaut that is Madden '07, which made the list twice. It was the number 1 game with 1.8 million copies sold for the PS2, and number 9, with 826,000 copies sold for the Xbox360. </p>
<p>I know there are those that love the Madden games, but I can't justify spending $50 on a game when Madden '06 can be picked up for under $10 used. Besides, everyone knows that football games reached their zenith with NFL 2K1 on the Dreamcast.
