I don't think RC puts enough faith into other people.... I don't know how I would screw up the place that bad in 3 or 4 days, unless you count the comics.

<P>Anyway, rumor has it that Microsoft is going to <A HREF='http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=pub&aid=1747'>release a smaller version of the XBox</a> in Japan. If the rumor is true, and they can do it without redesigning the console, why didn't they do it in the first place? Are there giants in Seattle designing game consoles and controllers for Microsoft? We have a console that is the largest thing since the Atari 5200 (thank goodness it isn't larger than the 5200) and huge controllers. I'm surprised they didn't design an 8 inch DVD drive for the thing. Their advertising would go something along the lines of "Our console is the biggest, baddest thing ever. It can crush the puny GameCube and PS2. In a fight to the death the PSOne doesn't have a chance!".
<br />
<P>And finally, one man's <A HREF='http://maddox.xmission.com/xbox_suckit.html'>seven reasons</A> on what's wrong with the XBox.
<br />
<P>P.S. History tidbit: the floppy disk was 8 inches at first, before it shrunk to 5 1/4 and then finally 3 1/2.
