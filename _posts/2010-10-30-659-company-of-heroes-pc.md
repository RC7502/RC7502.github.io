This is an ongoing feature of me playing the games in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789320908?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0789320908">1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0789320908" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> 

"It's trick is quite straightforward: It tries really, really hard to be HBO's Band of Brothers." 
- Duncan Harris

I'm not a big fan of real time strategy games. I'm even less a fan of World War II themed games, so I suppose Company of Heroes had two strikes against it from me from the start. Biases acknowledged, I booted up the game and played through the tutorial. I learned how to move my squads, throw grenades and bring in reinforcements. Once I started the actual game I got really bored really fast. The computer points a big green arrow at a bad guy, and I select my squad and send them after said bad guy. Repeat 3 or 4 times to finish the first level. I definitely can't say CoH is a bad game, I'm just clearly not the intended audience. This looks like it would be fun for people who are fans of Warcraft III or Starcraft but want a different setting, or history buffs looking for a WWII game that's not a first person shooter. 

<strong>Does it belong in 1001 Great Video Games?</strong>
No. I think it's audience is too niche. I believe when you pick the best video games of all time you should pick games that are going to appeal to the widest selection of gamers.
