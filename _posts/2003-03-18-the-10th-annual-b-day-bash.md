Russ pretty well covered it. We did have a Timesplitters 2 tourney and my team of Me (Kruton6), Tim (The Tim), Justin(M109-Animal) and Jeffy (Jeff) came in 2nd to the "Butt Darts" crew of Kegan (Butt Darts), The Rogg (The Rogg), AJ (SJ) and Jimbobway (HumanShld). So props to them at beating us. It was a 2 xbox Team Multiplayer tourney and we had 4 teams. (No, I didn't even stack them) In other news I got some new toys. Digital Voice Recorder, Wireless remote for Mac and PC, and an iPod. I've been pretty busy as I applied for an App to go to San Jose CA for WWDC which is the Apple World Wide Developers Conference. Well, I'll post more later, I gotta head to class.
