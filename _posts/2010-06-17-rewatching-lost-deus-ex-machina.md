It opens on Locke trying to break into the hatch. Then we get a flashback of Locke selling games at a store. Yeah kid, Mouse Trap is fun once you spend an hour setting it up. We know this is the past because Locke has hair.

On the island: Locke gets all weird and mystical and Boone follows him instead of realizing he's crazy.
Off the island: Locke finds his mother, who is crazy, and his father, who is a jerk. 

We don't get the answer of how Locke gets paralyzed yet, but Locke and Boone do find a Nigerian priest in the jungle. There's also a really cool moment when Boone is on the radio and says "we're the survivors of Oceanic 815" and then someone replies "no, we're the survivors of flight 815." Also the light turns on in the hatch at the end.
