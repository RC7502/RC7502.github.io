After randoming selecting 2 random reviews posted during the month of July the winner of the T-Shirt contest is myself and kruton!! Just kidding, the real winners are rachel4 and TheRogg. I need these two people to give me their shirt size and address. If you didn't win you can still get a T-Shirt by clicking <a href=http://www.cafepress.com/bitsmack/>here.</a> Keep posting reviews, you never know when I'll be giving away stuff again.
