Happy Thanksgiving all!<br />
<br />
I have been a little lax in my posts since RC changed interfaces, turned me into a regular user,  didn't allow people to post news, and when I finally got around to posting, got timed out of my login and lost my story.<br />
<br />
RC always told me Bitsmack was my blog so I'll vent a bit.<br />
<br />
Thanksgiving<br />
I'd like to give thanks for the people who are always there for me.  I've been messed with a lot this past week and I'm somewhat thankful for that.  It hurt at first but I realized what kinds of ppl some ppl really are.  I'm surprized that ppl don't think I'll hear what they're saying when they talk about me behind their back in FINDLAY.  C'mon!! I don't even know the names of everyone who knows me!!  If you talk about me on campus it's BOUND to get back to me.  You might as well say it to my face.  Just say, <B>"Hey I deleted your AIM buddy list"</B> or <B>"Yes I'm talking about you and your g/f behind your back."</b> or even <b>"I won't play on your DDR machine if it comes to campus because I like the mall better."</b><br />
<br />
Aren't friends wonderful!! :) It's even made me think a bit about who I "trust" and who I trust.  Basically for the month of November the only things that have been good are Kim, Konami, Namco, my family, work and online friends.<br />
<br />
Online friends<br />
I have to comment.  This month I've met new people via <A HREF="http://www.bemanistyle.com">bemanistyle</a>. David, Thad and Malcolm have been really cool about meeting me online.  I actually ran into Thad when I was in Westland and got to witness his godlike powers of Guitar Freaks.  And of course <A HREF="http://www.vjarmy.com">Remy</A> doesn't really care if I talk to him or not but at least he hasn't blocked me yet :)<br />
<br />
On to the games:<br />
This month saw titles from <a HREF="http://www.konami.com">Konami</a> with <A HREF="http://www.konamijpn.co.jp/products/mgs3/english/index.html">Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater</a>, <A HREF="http://www.konamihwi.com/ddr_ultramix2/">Dance Dance Revolution: Ultramix 2</a>, <A HREF="http://www.konamityo.co.jp/bemani/ddrfestival/index.html">Dance Dance Revolution: Festival</a>, <A HREF="http://www.konamistudio.co.jp/pm10/">Pop 'N Music 10</a>, and <A HREF="http://www.konamistudio.co.jp/bm2dx8th/">Beatmania IIDX 8th Style</A> while <A HREF="http://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo</a> released the <A HREF="http://www.nintendods.com/index.jsp">Nintendo DS</a>, and <A href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1699&">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>.<br />
