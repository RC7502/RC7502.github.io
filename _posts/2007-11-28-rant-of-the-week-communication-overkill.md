I'll admit as a software developer I like to avoid contact with the outside world as much as possible. Email has been fine for most situations and sometimes talking on the phone is a necessary evil. But one my biggest annoyances is when people use <strong>multiple </strong>methods of communication to send <strong>one </strong>message. <br />
<br />
The most common example of this are people who send me an email and then <strong>immediately </strong>call me to make sure I got the email and what I thought about it. I only have Outlook check for new messages every five minutes so most of the time I haven't even <strong>received</strong> the email let alone read it and responded to it. Heaven forbid I get up to go to the bathroom and I don't see your message for <strong>seven</strong> minutes. <br />
<br />
Here are the guidelines for deciding which method of communication to use:<br />
<br />
1. If you are sending me a message that is not urgent and I don't have to stop what I am working on this second, send an email.<br />
<br />
2. If the message's urgency is greater than the lost productivity of stopping in the middle of writing code then call my phone.<br />
<br />
See there are only two guidelines, it's easy and fun! <br />
<br />
Today's story is the most ridiculous example I've had, and the catalyst for this post. I receive an email from a coworker. Since I was not knee deep in Visual Basic I read it and started a response. The coworker then called the main office number and told someone to tell me he was about to call me on my cell phone. Yes, that's right, called someone to tell me he was about to call me on my phone. Then he calls my phone and asks if I got the email. For those of you at home keeping track on your interruption score pad that is <strong>three</strong> interruptions just to give me <strong>one </strong>message.<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is, if you work in an office think about how important your question is before asking it. If you would like you questions met with disdain and contempt then by all means follow the above example. However, if you don't want to be douchebag then use my simple guidelines. <br />
