It's been one of <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=407>those days.</a>
<br />

<br />
So I am at Meijer the other day and I always check out their game selection even though the prices aren't the most competitive. I haven't got a great deal there since the $4.90 Dreamcast VMU find of '01. Anyway I see Serious Sam for the Game Boy Advance! Through all the gaming mags and websites I read I have never heard mention of this game. So today I go online to find some reviews and I can't find any information whatsoever. I know this may not be the greatest game release ever but I like to be an informed consumer before I make a purchase.
