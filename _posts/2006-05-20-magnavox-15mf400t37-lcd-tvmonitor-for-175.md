I found this monitor on clearance at Target in Columbus at Polaris today for $175. If you were looking for a vga monitor with composite/s-video hookups you may want to look at this. Be forewarned, mine does NOT work very well at all with my classic systems (Atari 2600, Atari Flashback 2). It does work fine with my PS2.
