We open with Sawyer using the Jack method of CPR where you kick the ass of the victim until they start breathing again.

On the island: Michael and Sawyer bicker on the open seas.

There's not a lot that happens in this episode. The first two episodes could have been combined together and give the same information. We do get to see the sweet computer where they have to type in numbers. 

Ashley's note: It blended in with the last episode since they take place at the same time.
