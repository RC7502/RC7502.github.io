According to <a href=http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/nintendo-ds-probable-price-launch-date-leaked-021274.php>this article</a> at Gizmodo, the Nintendo DS is rumored to be released Nov. 30 for about $200. Although that is the day after my birthday, a price that high might make me wait to purchase it.
