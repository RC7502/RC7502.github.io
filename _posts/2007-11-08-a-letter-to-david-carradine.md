Dear David Carradine, <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You were in Kill Bill 1 and 2. You were freaking Bill! That is why it pains me to see you in horrible Yellow Pages commercials. Is it a money thing? Are you just bored? There's no reason the guy from Kung Fu should have to advertise a piece of reference material rendered obsolete by the Internet. C'mon man.
