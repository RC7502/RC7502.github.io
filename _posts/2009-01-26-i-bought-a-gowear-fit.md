Now I've run five marathons but haven't really lost any more weight. In fact, over the holidays I've put on about 10 pounds. I have been tracking my calories eaten and burned through <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/">The Daily Plate</a> but it hasn't had any effect. I have been watching The Biggest Loser mostly because it is warning of what would come if I stopped working out completely. On the show, the contestants wear this sensor on their arm called <a href="http://www.bodybugg.com/index.php">BodyBugg</a>. It uses an <span class="info-text">accelerometer and temperature sensors to measure how many calories you burn throughout the entire day. Since I love statistics and gadgets I decided to check it out for myself. The makers of BodyBugg also make a slightly cheaper version called <a href="http://www.gowearfit.com/">GoWear Fit</a> (the name coming from some kind of random fitness word generator I assume). In my research the only difference between BodyBugg and GoWear Fit is that Bodybugg you have to put in what you eat every day, and GoWear Fit you only have to do it every three days. Also GoWear Fit will track your sleep and BodyBugg does not. Amazon has a special where you get the armband sensor and a wrist display for $199. The wrist display is optional and just shows you how many calories you've burned during the day. I had some Amazon gift cards to get this for even cheaper. There is also a subscription to use their website that is something like $7 a month. I'll find out for sure when the device comes.</span>

Basically, what I'm looking for is a more accurate target on how much I can eat every day, as well as a fun new gadget to keep me motivated in running. I'll post regular reviews once it arrives so check back here for more info!
