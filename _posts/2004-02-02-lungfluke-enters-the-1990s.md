First, we got a microwave oven in 1999, and now, in the glorious year of 2004, I am finally the proud owner of a <b>Game Boy Color</b> system.
<br />

<br />
While all of you other rotten BitSmackers prattle on and on about your GBA SP's connected to your GameCubes connected to each other over your high-speed internet connections connected to your Xboxes and PS2's and a zillion other gamers around the world, I'm playing...
<br />

<br />
<i>(...dramatic pause...)</i>
<br />

<br />
<b>Kirby's Dream Land</b>!
<br />

<br />
Oh, I'm not jealous.  I <i>enjoy</i> playing dippy little Nintendo titles in simulated color (since this game is a B&W game for the original Game Boy).  I <i>enjoy</i> living in the past.  I <i>enjoy</i> playing <b>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</b> for the zillionth time.  Why would I want something new, with all that crappy 3-D and full-frame-rate video and beautiful sound?
<br />

<br />
OK, maybe I am a <i>little</i> bitter.  I'd love to have the money to have all these new games, and the time to play them... but I don't.  So, this Kirby game suits me perfectly.  I can sneak in a few levels while I'm on the crapper, and I can win the thing in way less than an hour.  Plus, Kirby positively cracks me up!  Sucking in bad guys and spitting them back out...  a classic Nintendo acid trip!
<br />

<br />
I'll be expanding my GBC library over the next few months.  Be sure to check out my reviews here on BitSmack.  (BTW, do I still need to finish the games before writing a review?)
