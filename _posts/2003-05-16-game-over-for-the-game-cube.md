<P>According to <A HREF='http://news.com.com/2100-1043-1003661.html?tag=nl'>this article</A> publishers are taking a long hard look at whether it is worth it to develop for the GC.
<br />
<P>And Nintendo's response? Instead of working on great titles for the little box, they want to piggy back it to the GBA. How long will it be before the GBA is their main machine and the GC is just a peripheral that you use at home?
