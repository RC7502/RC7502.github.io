Sorry about not posting in awhile. School's beating me down again (well that and Kim[not beating me down but keeping me occupied ;)]). If you must know I've been seeing this really great girl lately (yes mom, now you know ;-P) and looks like she'll be heading down to Easton for the great OS release at the Ole' Apple store.
<br />
<br />
Lately my life has consisted of Mac's, n-gage, school and Kim.
<br />
<br />
I've got almost every high score in Monkey Ball so I might have to <b>remove my battery</b> and insert Tomb Raider since games are still WAAAAY too expensive.
<br />
<br />
Still the Findlay area cannot call Nokia.... :-\
<br />
I'd also like to give a shout out to my new DDR buddy Ed, who's up to standard on the controller in DDRMAX 2 US.
<br />
<br />
My game life is turning into DDR. I started playing Starfox Adventures and I'm enjoying that! I also had a free night and played Worms Blast for my GC. He sure is getting a lot of use lately, I blame it on <a HREF="http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=55">wireless controllers! It's great to be able to sit anywhere in my house and play Gamecube!</a>
<br />
<br />
Well that's about all for now since class is about over.
<br />
