In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SVMK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bitsmack-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004SVMK">Air Fortress</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00004SVMK" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> you play some kind of space terrorist that rides a rocket sled into enemy bases, destroys the core, then flies out before it explodes. There are two main parts of each level, the first is when you are on your sled blasting things trying to get to the base. This section is similar to shooters like R-Type or Life Force. The second section is when you get inside the base you have to get the the core on foot. This section is more like a side-scroller like Mega Man. Most NES games that try to mix multiple genres fail miserably, but Air Fortress pulls it off. You can tell a lot of work went into this game because of the little touches that make it shine. For example when you are on foot you use your jet pack to fly to different platforms. If you shoot while flying, you'll be propelled backwards. I think Air Fortress is really an underrated game and worth checking out. I give it an A-.
