Today:<br />
Kingdom Heart Chain of Memories, and Pop 'N Music 12 Arcade came out.<br />
<br />
Yesterday:<br />
Kotor2 for xbox!!<br />
<br />
Well I'm going out to pickup my copies of Kotor2 and KH:CoM and I'll probably never play pnm 12 until it comes out for CS.... :(<br />
<br />
I've been working on exams and scheduling for classes lately.  I've got one semester left and then the work force gains a K-dog.  Just wanted to let everyone know I am still alive despite my abscence from the site.  I've been working on the Beatmania IIDX 11th RED videos for Bemanistyle.  I'm not sure when they'll be up over there but keep an eye out for them.<br />
<br />
Next semester is looking good for me to have time to work on some new projects so 2005 may very well be the year of the K-dog :)<br />
<br />
So until then,<br />
K-dog out!
