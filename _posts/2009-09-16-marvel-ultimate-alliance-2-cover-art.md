Why the heck is Spider-Man front and center on the cover of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2? He got to be on the cover of the last one! Since the storyline centers around the Civil War storyline why not use one of the two main characters Iron Man or Captain America? Iron Man was in a hugely successful movie last year. I think he should have been an obvious choice. Maybe they didn't want to favor one side over another, then why not use Hulk or Wolverine? Seriously, I like Spider-Man but quit hogging the spotlight web-head!
