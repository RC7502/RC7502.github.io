Here we go!

It's a Wonderful Life tries to go the artistic route by being shot in black and white. Uh yeah, Clerks already did that. The movie starts out in space, the final frontier. The galaxies are talking to each other about some sad dude on earth. They decide to send their most retarded guy to help him. When George Bailey was a kid he lost hearing in his ear trying to save his brother. Luckily it didn't cost George his job as a bartender at a pub for children. George's dad is Bob Cratchit working for Scrooge. George works for some old man and talks him out of killing himself or something.

Fast forward to George as a grown up living with his parents like a sucker. George's dad wants George to go into the family business. Then there's a dance and George and this girl Mary are getting down Charleston style. Alfalfa gets jealous and opens the dance floor so they fall into the swimming pool underneath. George's dad dies and George fills in for him at the office. The hilarious thing is that Scrooge bad mouths their company for giving out too many loans and HE'S the bad guy. Nowadays the economy is in the mess its in because everyone gives loans to anyone. So George's brother goes to college and George stays home to run the business.

Later, George asks out this blond woman and an entire crowd gathers to laugh when he gets shot down. The 1920s rocked! Rejected, he wonders into Mary's house. They head upstairs and come down married. Just as they're ready to go on their honeymoon George's company runs out of money or something. George gives away his own honeymoon money to help the people. 

George's business is going well again, too well. Scrooge doesn't like it so he offers George a job but George refuses because Scrooge is evil. Time passes and George has a few kids. His partner loses $8000 and now George is in big trouble. He goes to Scrooge for help and Scrooge calls the cops on him. George hits rock bottom and decides to jump off a bridge. Before he has a chance that retarded angel from the beginning jumps in instead and George saves him. George wishes he had never been born and the angel decides to show him that. George sees that things would have sucked so he wants to live now. When he gets home the whole town rallied together to raise the money George needed and the angel gets his wings. I give the movie a 3.5 out of 5.
