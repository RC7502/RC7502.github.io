Even though the comic is recaping some of the highlights of RC and Ashley's trip to Disney World, I thought I would write up the experience as well. Even though it rained every day it was still one of the best vacations I've ever had.

The alarm went off at 4am Sunday morning. My biggest worry leading up to vacation was that we would miss our flight or something would go wrong. Luckily we had everything packed the night before and we got through the airport security in no time at all. Our flight left at about 8am and it was early arriving to Orlando by about a half hour. We took Airtran which was ok except for their lame $15 per bag policy. In retrospect our suitcases were probably small enough to fit in the overhead compartment. Once we were at Orlando we didn't have to worry about our luggage because it was being delivered to our room automatically. We hopped aboard the Disney Express bus and we were on our way to the All Star Music resorts.

You can think whatever you want about the Disney coorporation but when it comes to their resorts and theme parks they really go all out in every way. Their customer service is top notch and they will go out of their way to make sure you have a good time. The All Star Music resort had buildings separated into different genres: calypso, jazz, broadway, rock, and we were in the country building. Everything is bright and colorful to appeal to kids. There were several pools so we didn't have to worry about getting overrun with kids while swimming.

When we booked our trip we got the Disney dining plan and now I am really glad we did. Our plan got us 1 snack (pop, water, ice cream, fruit, cookies), 1 quick meal and 1 sit down meal per day. The food at the parks is very expensive. Each of our quick meals would cost between $20-30 and our sit down meals would be $60-70 if we didn't have the dining plan. If say 2 snacks are $8, quick meals are $25 and sit down are $65 that's $98 per day. Take that for 7 days and its $686. I don't remember exactly what the dining plan cost but I know it wasn't that much. We used our first quick meal at the restaurant in the hotel. I got a personal size pizza and a big cookie and they were delicious. The hotel room was a basic room: two beds, a table, and a TV. Their TV channel selection was pretty weak but we wouldn't be in the room very long anyway. They had like 4 channels devoted to just telling you what was going on at the parks. We took at nap until our luggage arrived and then it was off to adventure!

We decided the first day to check out Downtown Disney. It's not technically part of the parks but it's supposed to be more for grown ups. Maybe it was because we were there in the middle of the day but the place was a ghost town. There are a ton of Disney stores in the first section and they were pretty cool, especially the toy store and the Lego store. The farther we walked away from the Disney section the more deserted it became. Maybe this place is cool at night but I wasn't seeing it. We watched a show choir from Mississppi do a few songs. It was fun to watch in a "this is unbelievably corny" sort of way.

We had dinner at Cap'n Jack's which I don't think had anything to do with the Pirates movies. Ashley had salmon and I had crab cakes. After dinner it started raining as we headed to the bus to take us back to the hotel. On the bus ride home was the experience that happened in the last comic. Overall, if you went to Disney World and didn't go to Downtown Disney you wouldn't be missing much if anything. Even though there were a lot of stores there are also a lot of stores at the parks so I don't see Downtown Disney as a "must do".
