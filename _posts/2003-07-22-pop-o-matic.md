I hate to admit but you all probably know anyway, I am addicted to Rhythm games!! If you haven't seen my house I'm pretty much burdned to never have a decent DDR pad, and my halls are lined with weird controllers. I haven't been doing much but playing Pop N Music 8 and barely tried IIDX 4th style. 
<br />

<br />
BTW, if you have the small Konami IIDX controller,  do yourself a favor by taking out the rubber stoppers lining the buttons on the inside. My buttons were sticking and I took out the stoppers and now it works fantasic! Put them in a zip lock baggy and stuff them in your IIDX box if you're worried about losing them.

A number of ppl have messaged me lately concerning my new Guitar Freaks controllers. Yes, they are Konami. Yes I got them used but my guitars are uncannily responsive! I have recently found information of why NOT to get off brand GF guitars. One brand has issues with timing (can't remember which one), Topway guitars have trouble strumming and stumming upwards causes the sensor to stick. If any hardcore GF players are reading this you know that you have to be able to strum up to pass harder songs.

I went to the mall to get KOTOR yesterday and unfortunately they were sold out. O well, maybe I'll win that copy of Pop N Muisc for GB on ebay :)

On one final note ParmaPowerhouse tourney is this Saturday and FindlayExtreme is under new management ( :( ) and is prolly gonna be pretty sad since Mike's never run a real DDR tourney in his life. The tourney is on Sunday. I'll be at both.

See ya Thursday,
<br />
K-dog out!
