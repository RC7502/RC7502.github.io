For years, people of all ages, races, religions, and genders have been telling me how great the Harry Potter books are. Up until now I've avoided it because I'm not really into the magic/fantasy genre. I'm more interested in science fiction. One you create a world where magic exists you can conveniently come up with a spell to get you out of any situation (Granted, Star Trek has been know to come up with whatever technology they need to get out of situations as well). 

With the new Harry Potter movie released this week, the trailers actually looked pretty good. But if I wanted to see the new one I'd have to watch all the previous ones. So over the course of 4 days Ashley and I watched 5 Harry Potter films. Here are my in depth and insightful comments on each one. There are probably spoilers but I think everyone else on the planet knows these by now.

<strong>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</strong>

I had seen this one before but it was a long time ago. Basically Harry Potter is a boy who lives in the present day but goes to a magic school where everyone loves pretending its the middle ages. Are students forced to check their iPods at the door or something? <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/quidditch-is-bullshit/">Quidditch is the stupidest game ever</a> and I'm pretty sure J.K. Rowling has never seen a sporting event in her life. I was pretty tired so I slept through most of the middle. The dark arts teacher has two faces and when Harry touches him he turns to dust. I thought it was really cheap at the end when Dumbledore gives Gryffindor made up points just so they win.

<strong>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</strong>

Encyclopedia Brown is back for his second year of solving mysteries. Gollum shows up at the beginning just to cause trouble. The new dark arts teacher is supposed to be this famous wizard but he turns out to be a flake at the end. I'm beginning to see a pattern here. There is a giant snake thing that is freezing students. Harry defeats it, though a bird did most of the work. 

<strong>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</strong>

I really shouldn't have been playing Sims 3 because this one was the toughest movie to follow. The new dark arts teacher is a werewolf this time. But there is another guy that looks like a werewolf, and a guy that turns into a rat. They're all friends or something. Everything bad happens then we find out Hermione has this time travel device she uses all the time. They go back and set right what once went wrong, and hope the next leap will be the leap home. 

<strong>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</strong>

Mullets are all the rage at Hogwarts this year. Either that or their barber went on strike. Some visiting schools show up for this Tri-Wizards Cup event. I don't know where the Tri comes in because there weren't three wizards or three cups. The contestants are Edward Cullen, a Russian guy, a girl and Harry, even though he didn't throw his name in because he's too young. The first event was stealing an egg from a dragon. The second event was rescuing people underwater (the insurance premiums for this school must be astronomical!). Neither of these events mattered because the final round, a maze, would decide the winner. Also, between rounds they had a prom. At the end of the maze Voldemort returns and kills Edward Cullen. Harry was pissed and then escapes. Oh and this time the dark arts teacher was Doctor Who pretending to be a different guy with a pool cue for an eye. 

<strong>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</strong>

Harry Potter is expelled for claiming Voldemort has returned, but that gets resolved in like 5 min. There are a group of good wizards planning to battle Voldemort even though the rest of the world refuses to believe he's back. Laura Bush is the new dark arts teacher and then ends up taking over the school and enforcing a ton of rules, just like what they did to Robocop in Robocop 2. Harry trains his army in secret until they get found out. Then he and his friends and the good wizards fight Voldemort's goons and it is a pretty spectacular battle. They should have been doing this in all the movies. Dumbledore and Voldemort have a showdown like Yoda and Dooku in Episode 2. Voldemort runs off but not before being seen so everyone believes Harry now.
