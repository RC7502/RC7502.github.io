Ever since I was about 10 I have been into Marvel Comics. I loved Ghost Rider in the 90s and just about every X-Men spinoff title that was released. One thing I've never done is read DC Comics. However, when I heard DC was starting over all their titles with #1 to lure in new readers I figured now would be as good of time as any to try it out. I mean I like Batman. So I read every #1 issue of the new 52 and here are my thoughts. 

<strong>Action Comics</strong><br>What I think is going on: 
This is Superman in his early days I guess. I don't really understand the jeans and cape look.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe, I liked this one better than the other Superman book.

<strong>All Star Western</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Jonah Hex and Arkham solve murders in old timey Gotham. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe, I do like Westerns and this one ties in to Batman in a way.

<strong>Animal Man</strong><br>
What I think is going on: There's a guy like Mickey Rourke that has animal powers. Some weird stuff happened at the end.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Probably not. It didn't really hook me.

<strong>Aquaman</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Aquaman is finally aware of how much he gets made fun of on Family Guy.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe, it was better than I thought an Aquaman book would be.

<strong>Batgirl</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Even though I haven't read any DC comics I did know that Barbara Gordon was shot and paralyzed. In this comic she can walk again and they don't explain why. Also someone at the end freaks out for a reason that makes no sense.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Probably not. 

<strong>Batman</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Batman and the 3 former Robins kick lots of ass.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Probably. This was one of the best comics out of the new 52.

<strong>Batman and Robin</strong><br>
What I think is going on: This one focuses on Batman and his son. What I liked was that Batman said he was finally going to move on and stop crying over his dead parents. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe not if I am already reading the regular Batman book.

<strong>Batman the Dark Knight</strong><br>
What I think is going on: It's like they took the same story from the regular Batman #1 and made it crappier.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Nope, this one blew.

<strong>Batwing</strong><br>
What I think is going on: This is Batman in Africa. He has a whole bunch of different problems.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Not sure on this one, it was kinda interesting but didn't blow me away.

<strong>Batwoman</strong><br>
What I think is going on: I have absolutely no idea. I don't know anything about this character and this issue did a terrible job of introducing her.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Definitely not.

Stay tuned next time when I review the next 10 comics.
