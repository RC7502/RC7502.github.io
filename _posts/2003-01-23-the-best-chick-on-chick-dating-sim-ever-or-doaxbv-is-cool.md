So I went out to Software ETC yesterday and saw Matt, played some DDR and picked up my new game. Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball and let me just say, THIS IS THE BEST AND HARDEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!!! Let me just say I'm not really a fan of fighting games but I loved Super Spike V ball for NES. 
<br />

<br />
So I start the game and I chose this Hitomi girl, and I'm paired up with Lisa. We win the first match and I get like 50000 points to spend on clothes and stuff and then Lisa leaves my partnership!! So the rest of the game is devoted to buying all the stuff in the game and making friend with the other girls so they'll become my partners!! NOT FUN! So I start reading the instructions, and after putting two and two together and realize that the girls have interests and I have to pay attention to that!! WHOA!!! I JUST found out that you get 15 days on the island and then you have to start again because a volcano erupts!!! Well you'll have to see for yourselves, I know I will be.
