<b>Big site update today</b>
<br />
Bitsmack has always been a site devoted to video gaming, classic and current. There is one aspect of classic gaming we have neglected: BBS Games. When I was in middle school, before the Internet, one of my friends had an older brother with a BBS (Bulletin Board System). It was great, we could chat, post messages and for the first time, play games "online". Well now you can step back in time and try out these games on the <a href=telnet://bbs.bitsmack.com>Bitsmack BBS.</a> Instead of having to dial into a BBS like the old days you can use your internet connection and a Telnet client. Don't worry, there's one built into Windows. Once you create a user you'll want to go to the "External Programs" section to play games. Right now the only game there is Legend of the Red Dragon. It's kind of like Everquest without graphics. I'm hoping to get Tradewars to put up soon because it is also a cool game. Try it out and let me know if you have any problems.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030423.gif'   />
