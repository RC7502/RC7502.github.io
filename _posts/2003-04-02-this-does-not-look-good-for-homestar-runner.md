Hello world. I thought I'd kick things off with a posting about my new game Amplitude. It's Aplitubular!!! I'm almost done with the game but can't wait to play online!!! Unfortunately Pending firewall issues are preventing me from doing so. Other than that Wheeler beat Zelda Wind Waker and needs to post something about it, preferrably on the News section, possibly under Video Game related news. I have Zelda and am farther than RC but I've stopped playing to hope to complete Super Mario RPG for SNES. Final Fantasy Origins comes out next Monday!! See you all lata!
<br />

K-dogg out!!
