Here's a <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=408>comic.</a>

So this week is pretty busy. Our company is holding a training class for resellers and users all week. Every night we take them out for dinner and drinks. Last night we went to a pub and I had to try Boddington's just because it was mentioned in a Friends episode. Everyone else was drinking Guiness so I would have been made fun if I had Bud Light or something. I'm looking forward to this week being over so I can have my evenings free again.
