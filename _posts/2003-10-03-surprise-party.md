It's no <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=339>surprise</a> that there is a comic today.
<br />

<br />
I know Rogue Squadron III is a couple weeks away from being released but I can't help poking fun at it because it bothers me so much. Everyone claims this game is something new but it's based on the most overplayed franchise in video game history. 
<br />

<br />
The day will come when Star Wars games will add the year to the end of their title like sports games. Teenagers who weren't even alive when Phantom Menace came out will have the following conversation:
<br />

<br />
"Hey, did you hear Star Wars 2006 is out?"
<br />
"No way man! I haven't finished the Death Star trench battle on Star Wars 2005 yet."
<br />
"Well I heard the Death Star trench battle on 2006 is much better."
<br />

<br />
I am a Star Wars fan, but I'd rather play something with a new storyline, like KOTOR. At least then I wouldn't have to shoot those darn AT-ATs anymore.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031003.gif' alt'' />
