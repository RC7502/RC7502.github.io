The episode starts with Sayid on the beach. Oh look he found the power cable for the island. The entire place is powered from an extension cord running underwater to Australia. 

On the island: While the rest of the group plays golf, a French woman tortures Sayid and then lets him go
Off the island: Sayid tortures a girl he knows and then lets her go

We get a lot of new info from Danielle Rousseau. She was with a group that landed on the island. She mentions the Black Rock and The Others. She had to shoot a guy named Robert because he went mad. She has a child named Alex whom is missing. 

Ashley note: zzzzzzzzzzz..... but she liked that Hurley set up a golf course.
