<blockquote>A UK bookmaker has lowered the odds on <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/3374240/Paddy-Power-offers-odds-of-4-1-that-God-exists.html">proving that god exists</a> to just 4-1 to coincide with the switching on of the Large Hadron Collider. The chance that physicists might discover the elusive sub-atomic object called the "God particle" has forced the odds lower. Initially the odds that proof would be found of God's existence were 20-1, and they lengthened to 33-1 when the multi-billion pound atom smasher was shut down temporarily because of a magnetic failure.</blockquote>
So there are people placing bets on whether or not God exists? What other far out things can I bet on? Can I bet on whether aliens exist or what year the Earth will be destroyed by a giant meteor?
