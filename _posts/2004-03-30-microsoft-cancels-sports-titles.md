In this <a href=http://sports.ign.com/articles/502/502713p1.html>surprising article</a> from IGN, Microsoft announces that they are taking a year off from all of their sports titles. Of course I'm skeptical about any news I read around April 1st but this one looks real. The article says that they recognize their games aren't as good as EA or Sega Sports. I wish more companies would recognize their shortcomings, like any company that releases a superhero game.

UPDATE: The fact that I haven't read this news on any other site leads me to believe it's an April fools joke. Oh well.
