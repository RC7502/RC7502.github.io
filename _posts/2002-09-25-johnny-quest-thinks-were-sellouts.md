As kruton blatenly pointed out yesterday I added a banner ad to BiTSMACK. <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=56>Today's comic</a> is a gross exageration of things to come. Until the server fairy comes and leaves a web server under my pillow, it still costs money to host this site. Don't worry, I would never stoop so low to put a pop-up ad on the site. Those are pure evil. If you want to help out BiTSMACK, you can click the banner and sign-up. Most of the offers advertised are free anyway so it's a win-win situation.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020925.gif'   />
