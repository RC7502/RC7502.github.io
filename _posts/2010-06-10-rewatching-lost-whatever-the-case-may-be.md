Kate and Sawyer go for a swim and they find a dead couple with a silver locked case. It's a Kate episode.

On the island: Kate is real secretive about what is in the case and it turns out to be something no one cared about anyway. 
Off the island: Kate and some dudes rob a bank so she can get into a safe deposit box. 

In this episode we see the beginnings of the Sayid/Shannon relationship, Locke and Boone are out trying to dig up The Hatch and there is one badass scene where Kate shoots a bunch of guys. 

Q: Kate said the toy airplane came from the man she loved/killed, what does that mean?
A: We'll find out in a later flashback.

Ashley's notes:
1. She liked the continuity with Sawyer's arm being injured.
2. She thinks its weird that Charlie and Rose became friends, but it is sweet that they prayed together.
3. She doesn't see Sayid and Shannon together. He is smart and nice and she is bitchy and shallow.
4. She wants to look like Kate.
