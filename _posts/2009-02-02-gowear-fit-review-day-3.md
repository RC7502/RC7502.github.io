Columbus is still in a level 2 snow emergency but I went to work anyway. I think chipping the centimeter of ice off my car helped burn some extra calories.

<strong>Sleep</strong>

My sleep is continuing to get better. This time my efficiency was 77%.

<strong>Exercise</strong>

I ran 3 miles on the treadmill before work under 10 min/mile pace. Later in the evening I walked on the treadmill while playing Persona 4 on my PS2. I have quite the treadmill entertainment center and I'll post pictures of it next week.

<strong>Diet</strong>

I had cereal for breakfast, leftover chicken and biscuit meal for lunch, and Little Ceasars pizza for dinner. Thursday night has become our pizza night since you can get a pizza already baked at Little Ceasars for $5.

<strong>Totals</strong>

Calories burned according to GoWear Fit: 2426
Calories consumed according to The Daily Plate: 1776
Difference: 650

At this point I don't think I really need to bore you with the results every single day. I am very happy with the information I get from the GoWear Fit monitor. I will still post weekly updates to see if I lose any weight.
