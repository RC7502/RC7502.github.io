Perhaps it was just work boredom, but a lot of awesome gaming stuff seemed to pop up today, or at least managed to grab my attention today. 

Starting off, for the frugal PS2 Owner in need of a new awesome game, God Of War, the brutally awesome action game, has become <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/246534.asp">a greatest hit</a> and experienced the subsequent price drop to $20. With any luck, Shadow of the Colossus won't be far behind.

For those who play World of Warcraft, this next bit might shock and disturb you, but pretty much any gamer who is familiar with the MMO genre can appreciate the gravity of what this video represents. Drakedog, someone's WoW toon commited suicide. This guy is adorned in all epic (purple) gear, which would have taken hundreds of hours to collect. He proceeds to destroy every last bit of it, put on some pants, and then deleted the character completely. You can check out the video <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7320193692512447072&q=Drakedog"> on google video</a>.

For those of you who haven't reached the cul-de-sac of being completely burnt out on WoW to the point of completly obliterating everything you'd invested time into forever, you might conisider an upgrade to your computer monitor! Dell's 2005FPW 20.1 inch widescreen LCD is on sale, 25% off. You can get an additional $35 off with a cupon easily purchased off eBay for $1 Buy it Now, and if you pay with your debit/credit card you can knock off another 2%, bringing the total price down to around $354, normally around $550-600. This monitor is considered by the gaming public to be the best monitor available, and it also uses the same panel as the Apple Cinema Displays.
