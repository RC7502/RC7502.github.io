Here is the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=333>conclusion</a> of Friday's comic.
<br />

<br />
Over the weekend I got to play some horrible NES games, stay up horribly late and perform horribly at a DDR tournament. It was a good time! K-Dog and Lynex came down for DDRMME 3. Friday night we went over to the Devryguyz and played some of The Rogg's collection of really bad NES games. There was Where's Waldo, Heroes of the Lance and Xenophobe just to name a few. On Saturday I played in the DDR tournament. They lured me in with a tshirt for signing up. I'm sure K-Dog will post more about the tournament. Sunday I got back into playing Knights of the Old Republic. I am on this insanely hard battle versus two big creatures on the Sith world. If anyone has gotten by this let me know how you did it. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030922.gif'   />
