<strong>Justice League International</strong><br>
What I think is going on: This is like the B squad of the Justice League.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Probably not. I like team books but this one didn't hook me.

<strong>Justice League</strong><br>
What I think is going on: In a flashback, Batman and Green Lantern are investigating this "Superman" guy. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Yeah. I see they are going to drag out this origin of the JL but I'll stick with it. 

<strong>Legion Lost</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Total incomprehensible crap. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Definitely not. They didn't put any effort into introducing this team or these characters. 

<strong>Legion of Super Heroes</strong><br>
What I think is going on: A super hero team of the future with like a million members. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe. I like the idea of a comic that takes place in the future. But I need to reread the first one to take in all the information.

<strong>Men of War</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Army guys go on missions in a world where Superman could stop all conflicts if he wanted to. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. I'm not a fan of army comics in general.

<strong>Mister Terrific </strong><br>
What I think is going on: Is this guy like Magneto? They didn't really explain how his powers work. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Probably not. It had some interesting moments but wasn't as good as other titles.

<strong>Nightwing</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Dick Grayson took over as Batman for awhile but now he is back to Nightwing. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe, I like the character.

<strong>OMAC</strong><br>
What I think is going on: A computer nerd gets transformed into a mohawk sporting Hulk. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe. This issue left me wanting to know more. 

<strong>Red Hood and the Outlaws</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Another former Robin goes by Red Hood and is putting a new team together. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. Starfire is a slut and not at all like the cartoon version.

<strong>Red Lanterns</strong><br>
What I think is going on: So Red Lanterns are like Green Lanterns, but angry and pointless. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Nah. I would like a first issue to give you some hint to what the title normally be like. And I didn't get that. 

Stay tuned for more reviews!
