<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=101>Today's comic</a> is up finally.
<br />
<br />
We got back late last night from going to Wright State to play DDR Extreme, the newest DDR machine released. It is really cool. There are songs from ALL the Bemani games, even Beatmania, Pop 'n Music and DanceManiax. It was a great day with the exception of the patchy snow on the ride home. I hope to get pictures from Bill to put up soon.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030108.jpg' alt'' />
