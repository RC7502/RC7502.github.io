I figured out why I was having such a hard time <a href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2009/09/01/super-mario-bros-3-day-one/">last time.</a> I had the B button set to autofire in the emulator. That was causing me not to be able to fly or pick up shells. Yes, I know it's not the most genuine to be using an emulator but I didn't feel like hooking up my NES and this gives me a way to save my progress when I only have a small amount of time to play.

Once I turned off rapid fire the game got a lot easier. I got past the half way point on world 2 and I'm about 1 level away from the castle. There is a hard underground level where you have to pick up those bowling ball looking guys and break blocks with them just to proceed. Hopefully I can spend some more time with it tonight.
