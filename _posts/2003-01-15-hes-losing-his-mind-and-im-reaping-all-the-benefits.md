It's Wednesday, here's a <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=105>comic.</a>
<br />
<br />
All this free time is getting a little boring, although I do have a job interview today. Even if I don't get this job I'm going to find something part time just to make some money and get out of the house. I'll post more information when I get back from the interview.
<br />
<br />
<b>Afterthoughts:</b>
<br />
My interview went pretty well. I won't know if I got the job for another week though. Stay tuned for the latest news.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030115.jpg' alt'' />
