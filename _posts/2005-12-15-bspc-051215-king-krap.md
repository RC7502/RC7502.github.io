This is the Bitsmack Podcast for <a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/dl/BSPC-051215.mp3">December 15, 2005.</a>

The first Bitsmack Christmas Carol:

Bitsmack the red-Gozed Podcast,
had a very funny Goz. 
And if you ever heard it
you would even say it shows.
All of the other podcasts
used to laugh and call it names
they never let poor Bitsmack
join in any podcast games (like Conker's)
then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
"Bitsmack with your Goz so bright
won't you host my show tonight?"
then how the podcasts loved it
as they shouted out with glee
"Bitsmack, the red-Gozed Podcat
you'll go down in history."
