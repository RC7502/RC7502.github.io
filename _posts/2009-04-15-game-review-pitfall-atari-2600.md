After releasing such hits as Kaboom! and Stampede it looks like they have another excellent game on their hands called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HMHNEW?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000HMHNEW">Pitfall!</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000HMHNEW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. In Pitfall! you play as Pitfall Harry, an adventurer similar to Indiana Jones from last year's movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Harry is combing the jungle trying to find golden treasure, but along the way he has to watch out for deadly pits, ferocious alligators, and cunning scorpions. To cross these obstacles you can swing on a vine from tree to tree. Your goal is to see how much gold you can acquire before the time runs out.

Pitfall! is one of the most innovative games to date. The graphics are excellent, the sound effects are great, and the controls are very responsive. My only minor complaint is that I thought the scorpions looked more like squirrels, but that doesn't take away from the game at all. We could be looking at a potential game of the year. I give it an A+.
