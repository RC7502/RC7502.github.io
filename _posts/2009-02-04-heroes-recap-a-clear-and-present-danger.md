Apparently someone at NBC said "people are complaining about this show being too complicated, I know! we'll make it more like Lost and Prison Break. More on that after the jump...

No previouslys! I totally forgot what this show is about!

It opens on Tracy. She is getting naked (her second super power) while a TV is on with Nathan talking about trying to get the Mutant Registration Act passed. A bunch of swat guys led by William Stryker rush in and capture Tracy. I think I will call them the Stryke Force. It turns out the easy way to subdue Tracy is by putting oven mitts on her.

Hiro and Ando are moving into the Ghostbusters headquarters. Hiro is all on board with becoming a spandex wearing, full fledged superhero. He unveils the Ando-cycle (which disappointingly looks like a regular motorcycle with a lightning bolt on the side. The two guys inject themselves with GPS chips so they always know where the other one is. It's like the 21st century equivalent of the "Best Friends" necklace.

Peter is an EMT now and trying to save a guy that has been clearly dead for awhile.

Angela is trying to get Claire into a good college but Claire only wants to go to party schools. Not really, she wants to go after Sylar because it was so much fun last season. Claire's all like "he's alive I know it" and Angela is like "no way, you're mental". Cut to Sylar going into another watch store to find his dad.

I'm starting to get bored when we get to Parkman and Speedster, this should liven things up. Parkman wants to live like normal people. BORING. If he wanted to live like a normal person why doesn't he go be on a show like Felicity or something.

Claire overhears Angela and Nathan talking about sending Stryker's Styke Force after Parkman. Angela's like "why did I have to talk about this on the phone so loudly with Claire in the next room?"

Sylar finds out the old dude is not his father but his uncle. I guess in the 70s instead of selling your baby you had to pay someone else to take them off your hands. Oh snap! I just realized that the song playing in the watch shop is the same one from the Fallout 3 commercial.

Back to Peter, his EMT buddy is worried about Nathan rounding up Iranians. Well it'll probably be mutants first then Iranians. Peter's like "you better worry about the government rounding up your family, WHEN THEY CAN THROW FIREBALLS". Peter gets in a cab with Suresh and they talk about the good old days, you know when Peter was trying to save the world and Suresh was working for the wrong people all the time.

The Styke Force comes after Suresh but he rips off the cab door and smacks Styker in his stupid face with it. He uses the door as a shield and then runs away. Noah shows up and is like "come with me if you want to live." Then he double crosses Suresh. SNAP!

Peter and Nathan stand around having the same argument all brothers have, whether or not it is right to put a whole class of people in internment camps.

Parkman starts talking to African Mr. Issac who now has the same apparition abilities as Obi Wan Kenobi. Parkman now has the ability to draw the future. Why is this necessary? Can't they make a story that is interesting without have to show us still images of what is to come?

Ando is at a strip club and he thinks the Ando-cycle is a chick magnet. Uh no, Ando those women just want your money. Meanwhile Hiro gets nabbed by the Stryke Force. Worst secret lair ever!

Claire shows at Parkman's and they look at his new drawings. Claire is like "hey this one is a picture of you getting shot in the neck through the window". Parkman is like "huh, that is strange I GAKKK!!!" (gets shot by stun gun, falls down).

Nathan is like "hey Peter give me a hug". It's funny because when Nathan says "give me a hug" it comes off as so much creepier than if he just hugged hium. Peter, being a moron, hugs him and takes a stun gun to the back.

Sylar finds his childhood home and gets swarmed by the Stryke Force. Unlike everyone else on the show who is freaking worthless against guys with stun guns, Sylar kicks all their asses and tortures a dude for information.

The mutants are getting loaded onto Con Air with some goggles and headphones so they can listen to their iPods during the flight. Nathan decides not to send Claire for some reason. Claire wakes up and since no one thought to restrain her, gets away and stows herself on the plane. She starts releasing everyone and Peter's ability changed so that he gets someones power as soon as he touches them. They all get free but Peter snagged Tracy's ice ability and froze a hole in the side of the plane. The plane is going down and Peter is close to flying out the hole.

TO BE CONTINUED!

Overall the episode wasn't that exciting till the very end. This season they're going to have a plane crash (just like Lost) and an escape (just like Prison Break). At least it seems like most of the cast will be in the same place working as a team this season so that is cool.
