<a href="http://nerdvana.freedomblogging.com/2008/11/11/star-trek-lore-beams-down-to-arizona-science-center/2622/">â€˜Star Trekâ€™ lore beams down to Arizona Science Center</a>
<blockquote>On Sunday the Arizona Science Center will open â€œStar Trek: The Exhibition,â€ a 12,500-square-foot collection of re-creations, sets, costumes and props from all five Star Trek TV series and 10 films over the last 40 years.</blockquote>
Unfortunately, Star Trek descending down on Phoenix will not be without casualties:
<blockquote>Thursday morning the Apache Junction High School Star Trek Club will don their Starfleet best on site in Phoenix with the Fox 10 morning crew to help promote the event.</blockquote>
