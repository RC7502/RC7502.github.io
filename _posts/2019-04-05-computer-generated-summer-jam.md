For today's comic I actually did take the lyrics from 25 old and new summer pop hits and ran them through a neural network. Here are some of the best results:

- The comin' got the summer in the street.
- Summer handless and I can see you what I'm a man
- I like sex, baby, I don't care
- I like like a day
- I like the summer in the summer streets
- I like like a girl
- I wanna be like, I wanna be like

- I don't care
- They're gonna be me
- Summer should be summer whoals
