<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=345>Today's comic</a> is the last time I make fun of the N-Gage... unless I run out of comic ideas, then it's POW! right in Nokia's jaw.
<br />

<br />
The wheel of interest is spinning once again, I've finally been able to identify all of my hobbies I switch between:
<br />
1. new video games
<br />
2. anime
<br />
3. classic video games
<br />
4. movies and TV on DVD
<br />
5. import video games
<br />
6. Heroclix, Magic, other non-video games
<br />
7. RPGs
<br />

<br />
As you can see I live a very full and rewarding life. Anyway, yesterday I started surfing some import game sites and stumbled upon a few really cool games. Here's some links so you can see that Japan gets a lot cooler video game stuff than we do.
