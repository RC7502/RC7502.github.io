In the current year both Microsoft and Sony have announced their plans to bring motion control to their systems. Are they trying to copy the success of the Wii or are they learning from Nintendo's mistakes? I'm going to argue the latter. 

When the Wii came out it was revolutionary. Rather than a controller full of buttons and thumbsticks it had a simplified remote control look. Nintendo consciously decided to abandon hardcore gamers and go after the casual non-gamer market. The problem with the Wii is that the remote works excellent for about 10% of games and crappily for the other 90%. The remote is like the guitar controller. The guitar is very nice for Guitar Hero and Rock Band but I wouldn't want to play a first person shooter with it. Unlike the guitar Nintendo forces every Wii game to use the remote even if it doesn't belong. 

Where Microsoft and Sony are doing things right is by making their motion controller a peripheral to be used on games where it makes sense. There's no rule being forced onto developers that every new game must use the motion controller. The result is that the hardcore gamers can play their games with the regular controller and casual gamers can play their games with the motion controller. Everyone wins! 

The Wii had motion control first and they're selling a lot of systems because of it. But once the other two systems do motion control plus hardcore gaming, better online play, voice chat and multimedia features, I think the Wii's days are numbered.
