So I go to the mall to play a bit and who do you think was already there? Sal was there playing some "Ooops, I did it again" double maniac trying to go for the high score. He has once more taken the top spot on the boards for single maniac. His "Japan" is AMAZING!! He score 47 mill b4 bonus in a full combo! I can totally understand how he got the high score. We actually talked for awhile and I just felt like trying to get along with him for once. I feel that there are way more people in the world that are big jerks than someone like Sal. Plus it's more fun to play with someone of your own calibur and if our machine makes it's 1300 tokens for the week, DDREX will be here in April!!

In other news, I stopped playing Xenosaga for the same reasons that I randomly stop playing RPGs, homework, other games and an upcoming LAN party at my bosses house. Well I'll see ya'll lata.
