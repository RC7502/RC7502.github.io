Once I got the first couple of emulators working, it became so easy I went a little nuts adding more emulators. I have the following emulators working through Game Launcher:
<br />
MAME - Arcade Games
<br />
Atari800Win - Atari 800
<br />
NNNesterJ - Nintendo
<br />
Gens - Sega Genesis
<br />
ZSNES - Super Nintendo
<br />
Z26 - Atari 2600
<br />

<br />
So far I've been using my Sidewinder game pad to test out games for all these systems. I'm going to buy the X-Arcade soon. Basically it is an arcade style joystick that plugs into the keyboard port. Before it arrives I have to remap the controls for each emulator to the correct keys on the X-Aracde. I'm worried that I can only close some of the emulators by using Alt+F4 and I'll have to figure out a way to change that. Overall I'm suprised at how fast I got things working on the software side. Once I get to the hardware side we'll see if those middle school industrial arts classes will finally pay off.
