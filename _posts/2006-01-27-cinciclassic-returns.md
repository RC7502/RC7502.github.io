<a href="http://cinciclassic.org/e107/news.php">Cinciclassic</a> is a classic video game convention located where else, Cincinnati OH. The last one was in 2002 but it will be making a comeback April 7 and 8, 2006.

At the last Cinciclassic I picked up a Sega Saturn, Sega Master System, a Power Glove and a few various games. K-Dog, Goz and I also discovered Para-Para Paradise, Drummania and Baku Baku Animal. Good times. This year we'll have some NES t-shirts to sell, and possibly the Bitsmack Volume 1 book and podcast archives on CD. I'll know for sure once it gets closer to April.

Here are some comics about it:
