Yes, this past weekend <a HREF='modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=365'>there was yet another awards show</a>. But wait, you say, <i>this one was different. It was to celebrate video games</i>. Then have a video game show... Don't have a 2 hour long LOUD commercial about games we all no should NOT get awards (such as <i>Enter the Matrix</i>). No nominations, who knows how they voted, and wrap it all up in a tight little sex package composed of cheerleaders and DOA volleyball girls. I guess this is how you sell things to the networks.
<br />
<p>And my final rant is the deceptive advertising for the show. All the ads featured classic arcade characters and sounds, where were these in the show?
