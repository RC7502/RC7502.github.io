We open on Hurley having a weird dream about eating. Jin shows up speaking English.

On the island: Hurley thinks everyone is going to hate him now that he is in charge of the food.
Off the island: Hurley thinks everyone is going to hate him when they find out he won the lottery.

We get to see the hatch for the Tail People. I bet it didn't take nearly as long for them to get into theirs. Inside is Bernard, so he's ok. 

Ashley's Note: She's glad that we met Bernard even though she knew he was going to be ok anyway.
