I mentioned last week that I needed to take a break because of the pain in my hands and fingers. I did some research and think I found the cause. All these years people have been talking about Carpel Tunnel Syndrome which occurs when you rest on your wrists while typing or using the mouse. I've been trying to avoid that so I hardly ever let my wrists touch the desk. Apparently there is another condition called Cubital Tunnel Syndrome. This one can occur when you lean on your elbows too much, which is what I was doing. It can also happen by bending it too much or sleeping on your arm, which I also did. It caused my ring and pinky finger to hurt pretty bad all the time. I wrapped up my left elbow so it wouldn't bend as much and I didn't use my left arm for a few days at work. It was hard to type with just my right but it was worth it because my left hand doesn't hurt as bad now. I've also made sure not to rest on my elbows at all. The pain is not 100% gone but I am hoping that if I go easy they'll eventually be back to normal. I just thought I would share since I had never heard of this syndrome before. Basically my advice is don't rest any part of your arms while on the computer, and take frequent breaks. Hopefully you won't run into the same problem I did.

Comics and articles to resume!
