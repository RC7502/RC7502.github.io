Yea, I haven't been on in awhile and a few things have changed. This was my last week of classes and as of know I have finals until next Wed and then I'm DONE for the year. I might be able to make Dean's list pending I study and don't mess up my exams. Aside from that I've been craving Drummania. Soon that craving will be fulfilled. Max2 came out in Japan and I should have mine next weekend!
