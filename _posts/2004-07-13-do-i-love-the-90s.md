When VH1 started their "I Love the 80s" show I thought it was awesome. By mixing pop culture history with comedians they had a great formula that would be the template for every other show on VH1. I argued with Goz that if they ever did an "I Love the 90s" show it would be even better since that is when I was in high school so I would probably be more nostaligic about those years. Now that they have started this show I have learned how I wrong I was. So far they have shown 90 and 91 and those years were a cultural wasteland. Michael Bolton, Wilson Philips, the Clarence Thomas trial, who looks back on these things with fond memories? There were a few things in each episode that were cool: grunge music, slap bracelets, Silence of the Lambs, MC Hammer, Vanilla Ice. Also, there is a little Jay and Silent Bob segment in each episode. Maybe it's too soon to look back on the 90s. I'll keep watching the rest of the episodes but I'm pretty convinced that the 80s were a better decade. What do you guys think? If you grew up in a different time period than me I'd like your opinion as well.
