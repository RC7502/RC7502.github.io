The challenge: Goz bet Brad and I that we couldn't get the MAME machine running by midnight Tuesday. On Saturday, after K-dog's party and a well needed nap, we headed to Lowe's for some hardware. The arcade monitor and controls came out really easy. However, the wooden frame that the monitor was attached to was another story. Somebody went crazy with the staple gun and it was going to take a lot of prying to get it loose. We decided this would be a good time to quit.

<br />
Sunday we got the frame ripped out of there but our next setback was that the 20in monitor I wanted to use was too deep to fit in the cabinet. Luckily I still had a 17in monitor I wasn't using. We built two shelves out of 2x4s for the monitor to sit on. All that was left was the X-Arcade. We decided to save that for Monday and played Risk instead.

Monday was another trip to Lowe's for some brackets to mount the X-Arcade. We also stopped by Best Buy to pick up some speakers. I bought Mario vs. Donkey Kong which is a great game. Brad got Smallville season 2. Boy that season had a lot of good episodes. What does this have to do with the cabinet? Well we watched Smallville while we worked on it. Take that readers beliefs! The X-Arcade was a pain to mount but we got it done. Then I just had to put my PC and speakers inside. We could then play arcade games on it and win the bet against Goz.

There are still some cosmetic work to be done on it. I want to get a custom marquee printed up for it. A guy I work with drew his in photoshop and had Kinkos print it up for a few bucks. I also want to put some custom artwork on the sides and around the monitor. I put up some more pictures of the work we did so far in the photo gallery.
