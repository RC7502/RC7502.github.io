Here you go. This <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=272>comic</a> should releave you of that Tuesday aftertaste.
<br />

<br />
I highly recommend TV. If you don't have one you should really look into it. Lately, I've been watching Trigun and Cowboy Bebop on Cartoon Network. If you are new to anime check these out. This Sunday, Family Guy is coming to Cartoon Network as well. If you get the chance, Sealab 2021, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and The Brak Show are good shows if you like weird cartoons that will actually make you laugh.
<br />

<br />
Here's a couple of site updates. First of all there is a new link to <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=FAQ&file=index>Ask Bitsmack.</a> You can ask about anything, video games, movies, the art of seduction. We are pretty much experts at anything. The second point of business is that I have dethroned K-Dog from the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=topmembers>Top Members</a> list. Granted he is in Florida right now, but that is no excuse. 
<br />

<br />
What I need from you the users are some ideas to make Bitsmack better. How can I set this site apart from the rest and provide incentives to post reviews? Keep in mind this site brings in no money, so the incentives would have to be non-monatary. I'm open to ideas to make this website keep growing. Click Comments to post your thoughts.

Oh yeah, one more thing. For the "Ask Bitsmack" I'll be answering one question a week, starting next Wednesday.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030416.gif'   />
