Another Tuesday, another round of 360 awesomeness. The Berb, Daddykin, Emmit Fitzhume and chill met for some 2 on 2 Gears of War. I have to say I thought everyone was pretty evenly matched. There wasn't anyone that won every time. Kruton7 finally decided to show up near the end. The highlights were:

chill rushing in and taking out both opponents right away
Daddykin using ninja like abilities with the chainsaw
I think it was The Berb who used the Hammer of Dawn as a finishing move
Emmit was doing pretty well for being new to the game
Kruton7 using DDR style flips to avoid enemies
chill gets hit by a train
