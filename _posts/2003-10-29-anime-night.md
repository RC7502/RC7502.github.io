Today's <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=349>comic</a> features the long overdue debut of the UF Bitsmacker April! Anime Night last Friday was a complete success. That is to say, if the success of an anime night is measured by whether people watch anime, then this night was successful. This time the theme was "non-giant robot" anime. We watched FLCL, Excel Saga, Trigun and Cowboy Bebop The Movie. After that we watched some Family Guy.

If you're not familar with Bawls, it is a caffeine drink that was founded by a group of 6th graders. It's nearly impossible to mention its name without spawning 10-20 minutes of jokes about the name. Tastes good though.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031029.gif'   />
