I downloaded and installed the free game released by the U.S. Army which is available at <a href=http://www.americasarmy.com>www.americasarmy.com</a>. This game accurately simulates what it is like being a soldier... a soldier frozen in time! Even at the lowest video settings the game was completely unplayable on my computer. I am due for an upgrade so I might try it again afterwards. Has anyone else had better luck? Click "comments" to post your thoughts.
