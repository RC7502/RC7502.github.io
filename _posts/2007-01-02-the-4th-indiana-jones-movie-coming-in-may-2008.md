<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/01/georgelucas.indianajones.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories">Lucas: 4th 'Indiana Jones' to shoot in 2007 - CNN.com</a>:<blockquote>George Lucas said Friday that filming of the long-awaited "Indiana Jones" movie will begin in 2007.  <br />
<br />
Harrison Ford, who appeared in the three earlier flicks, the last one coming in 1989, is set to star again.<br />
</blockquote>Unfortunately, after seeing what George did to the Star Wars movies, I'm a little afraid of what this movie will be. The good news is that Steven Spielberg helped finalize the script, and he hasn't steered me wrong yet (although Hook is questionable).
