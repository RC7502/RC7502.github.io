Now that id Software is <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">talking about making a Doom 4</a> a lot of people are hoping this will be better than Doom 3. I don't think Doom 3 was that bad, it was just one interpretation of the original Doom. Classic video games are like abstract art. Everyone is going to find their own meaning in what the art represents. Take for example the box art on old Atari 2600 games.

Most of the time you are thinking "this game doesn't look anything like the box." But to whomever chose the cover art, this is what the game is supposed to be.

So where am I going with this? If I were to list the top two reasons I enjoyed Doom it would be the fright aspect, and adrenaline rush of fighting numerous foes. Even though the game looks dated now, there were some scary moments back then, like the first time those goat legged dudes come at you or when you hit a switch and bad guys appear all around you. I also enjoyed the levels where you are in a wide open field with dozens of guys coming at you at once. Am I going to have enough ammo? Can I dodge all those fire balls?

When Doom 3 came out id decided to focus only on the scariness and turned it into a first person survival horror game of sorts. This disappointed anyone who didn't enjoy the originals for that reason. I say if you're looking for that adrenaline rush again pick up Serious Sam (Serious Sam 2 isn't as good). I thought Serious Sam could be a better sequel to Doom than Doom 3 but that's only because of my interpretation of the original.

In conclusion, when it comes to remakes of video games, TV shows or movies just remember that the new one is probably not going to give you the same feeling you had when you were 10. If you want that feeling just load up the original Doom. You can probably find a ton of new levels people have created.
