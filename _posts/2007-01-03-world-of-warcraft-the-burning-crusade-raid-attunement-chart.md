January 16th is coming, and to get you started, WorldsofRaids.com <a href="http://www.worldofraids.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2698">has the Raid Attunement Chart for the Burning Crusade.</a> It doesn't say whether it is the final chart, but with such tasks as "Quest Line for Normal Mode Key" and "Revered with Sha'tar" how can you go wrong?
