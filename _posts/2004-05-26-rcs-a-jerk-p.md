So last night I went to Toledo with Coach, and Trim-dog 5000 to meet up with monkeygrl, lynex and kornkid.  We arrived at MM round 5:45pm and found one of the 3 afformentioned person playing ddr when we arrived.  We decided to start our nite off with a lil pizza so she helped us pick out some food and then it was off to the gaming!
<br />

<br />
I started off with a lil ddr while coach and trim-dog hit the turtles machine directly behind the 2 ddr machines.  Monkeygrl watched cuz she was tired from her previous run.  I started out after a quick run on the EX machine I turned to Max2 for a lil oni action.  I failed paranoia bros by doing the Para Evo run backwards but it was koo b/c our pizza was ready.
<br />

<br />
I tried calling lynex a few times and could not get ahold of him at all.  Then coach suggested getting ahold of Airwick cuz he had just gotten back from Florida and he agreed to meet us sometime tonight.
<br />

<br />
After eating we hit Guitar Fraks 8th, Dance Maniax 2nd Mix, and Percussion Freaks 5th while trim and coach battled out for master of the universe in Air Hockey.  I had winner....

K-dog vs. Trim-dog!
<br />
TD plays slow.  He likes to stop the puck any chance he gets.  I'm a fast player.  I hit hard fast and bank shot.  I got Trim 2-0.  Then monkeygrl wanted a piece of me.  She plays like me.  It was a touch match.  I beat her 7-3 first game.  She beat me 7-6 in second game, and I beat her 7-5 in the third round.
<br />

<br />
Following that she got some video of my freestyling on GF8th which should be hilarious when I get it uploaded.  Then we played some DDR for awhile and I passed Maxx Unlimited Extra Stage with a B on the Max2 machine for the first time ever!! I fc'd Max300 but had 86 greats on extreme and then we were all getting pretty tired.
<br />

<br />
After arriving back at the homestead we had no internet access....  I was not happy but too tired to care.  I ended up just calling my girl b4 I went to sleep and got ready for another day of work.
<br />

<br />
Oh, and I said I'd say something about Christina who was working at MM's since she's one of monkeygrl's friends so there ya go :)

K-dog out!
