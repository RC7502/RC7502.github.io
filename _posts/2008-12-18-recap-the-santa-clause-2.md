In honor of the Christmas season I've decided to go back and look at obscure holiday movies that are on TV. This time it is The Santa Clause 2 starring Tim Allen. I liked the first Santa Clause movie. It was enjoyable and hit at the height of Tim Allen's popularity. I never saw 2nd one until it was on TV the other night. So here we go.

<!--more-->

The Santa Clause 2 picks up what seems like 20 years after the first movie. Scott Calvin is living it up as Santa while his son Charlie is now in high school and his ex-wife and Judge Reinhold have a new daughter. Trouble ensues when Charlie gets on the naughty list AND they realize that Scott has to find a wife by Christmas Eve or he can't be Santa anymore. He has already begun the desantification process and is slowly turning back to his normal self. Here is my first problem with the movie. I just don't find Tim Allen funny when he looks like Santa. He could have the funniest writing ever (which this movie is far from) but I still don't see Santa as a comedian.

While Santa is gone he leaves a toy clone of himself to run the elf workshop. It looks pretty much like Santa accept with a creepy Burger King-like face and hair. What I think is funny is that they have to trick the elves into thinking Santa was still there running things. Apparently the workshop is some kind of forced labor camp and if Santa was gone the elves would stage a coup.

Charlie got in trouble for tagging (that's what the young people call spray painting) the school in protest of the Principal's anti-christmas campaign. The Principal is Juliet from Lost and it's instantly clear she's going to be the love interest for Scott. Before Scott and Juliet hook up he does go on one blind date with Molly Shannon. Her scene was kinda funny which, given my dislike for her, made me really doubt how funny everything else was.

There is a scene in the first movie where kids line up to sit on Scott's lap because he looks like Santa. In this movie there is a similar scene, but Scott doesn't look like Santa anymore! This comes off as creepy. Although I am glad that Scott eventually does look normal because it would be hard to believe some woman would find Santa hot.

Scott invites himself along to Juliet's faculty Christmas party. Did I mention Scott has a watch that keeps track of how much magic he has so he doesn't use it all? Well he did. What's weird is that Juliet and Scott are talking about classic cars in movies and then he opens the door and has a carriage and two horses. If you're going to have two characters share an interest in classic cars why didn't he magically produce one to drive to the party? During their ride Juliet gives her sob story of why she doesn't believe in Christmas. Will she believe by the end of the movie? I think so.

My favorite scene is the teacher Christmas party. Everyone is so bored and just sitting around in silence. Scott uses some magic and gives all the teachers the toy they most wanted as a kid. They all have a great time playing with Toss Across, Easy Bake Ovens and Rock'em Sock'em Robots. Scott tells Juliet he's Santa and she flips out with good reason.

Meanwhile at the North Pole (a phrase I can't wait to use in a Heroes recap) the toy santa has turned into a tyrannt and plans on giving all the kids coal this year. He has an army of life size toy soldiers at his disposal.

In a weird sequence of events, Scott tries to knock one of his teeth out so the tooth fairy can fly him back to the North Pole. Luckily the new girl happened to have lost a tooth at that exact moment. Scott and one of his elves get to the pole and are instantly captured. Luckily Charlie repels in and saves the day. Seriously, the dude repels into places like a dozen times throughout this movie. Charlie knocked one of his teeth out to get to the pole the same way. They stop the toy santa and Juliet changed her mind and is all on board with marrying Santa. Scott turns back into Santa, and... Charlie gets his tooth back? Why the hell did that happen? Anyway, everyone lives happily ever after.

All in all, it's not a bad movie. It won't make you die inside or turn you away from Christianity. I rate it a 2 on my new movie review scale:

4 = own it
3 = rent it
<strong><span style="color: #339966;">2 = watch it on tv while doing other things</span></strong>
1 = watch it just to make fun of how terrible it is
0 = never watch under any circumstances no matter how curious you are
