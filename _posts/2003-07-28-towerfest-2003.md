<b>Movie Review: Pirates of the Caribbean</b>
<br />
I went in to see Pirates hardly seeing any previews and having no expectations. That being said, it was probably the best movie I've seen this summer. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom both give an enjoyable performance. It made me realize that no matter how much you spend on special effects, you still need characters with personality to make a good movie. The special effects in pirates were really good without being very obvious and distracting. I recommend this movie to anyone, because it has something for everyone.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030728.gif' alt'' />
