So RC comes up last friday and introduces us to Taiko No Tatsujin and says I'm getting another one to sell to you. If you've been keeping up with my addictions I have been wanting to play Drummania for a LONG time and whenever I do it's way to difficult for the Findlay DDR master. However Taiko is a different breed of drum game with only four sensors to keep track of. I love it! So I put in a bid for Taiko 2 and RC's bring my Taiko 1 and drum controller to Goz's this weekend! I smell another bitsmack live!

My good friend Dan tha Man has just emailed me saying I'm the new owner of 2 Konami Guitars! Plus I managed to win Drum 3rd Guitar 4th for cheaper than $60! It's a good day to have a friend like ebay :)

My Pop N Music 7th came in and I am totally hooked!! I'll more than likely be bringing my JPS2 to Kenton with me this weekend to play all these new awesome games!! See you all real soon!!
