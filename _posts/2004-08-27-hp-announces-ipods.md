Rather than releasing an inferior mp3 player, HP is <a href=http://www.chait.net/index.php?p=331>repackaging Apple's iPod</a> and selling it. The cool thing is they also give you printable stickers that wrap around the iPod to protect and personalize it.

Anyone else think it's odd to see two computer companies working together like this?
