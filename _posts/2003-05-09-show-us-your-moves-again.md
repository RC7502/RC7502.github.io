<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=282>Today's comic</a> is not an exaggeration.

<br />
Since I was able to beta test XBOX Live last year they gave me a year of service for free. That being said, I haven't actually used it for months. The only game I have is Mechassult. Even though there are some interesting games I'd like to play the headset is not as cool as you would expect. Everyone I come into contact with can be grouped into three catagories: 
<br />
1. People who spout profanity every other word
<br />
2. Nerds that are so annoying they couldn't possibly have real friends
<br />
3. Children who are also annoying because they talk too loud and/or use the stupid voice masking
<br />

<br />
Sure you can always mute someone who is annoying you but this isn't very feasible when you are playing a racing game like MotoGP. Ultimately, if I ever get another XBOX Live game I probably won't bother plugging in the headset. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030509.gif' alt'' />
