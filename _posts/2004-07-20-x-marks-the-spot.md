There's not a lot going on with me lately. My grandma passed away last week so I've had the visitation and funeral to go to. Per Brad's advice I went to the Men's Warehouse to get a new suit. They had the best customer service I've seen in a long time. I didn't have to know sizes or matching colors or anything, they hooked me up with a whole outfit.

Cassadi got me to watch this anime series called X. I have watched 5 of the 8 dvds. It is pretty good but a little confusing at first since like 5 of the characters look very similar. I am looking forward to seeing how it ends. Brad, Cassadi and I watched the first disc of Trigun last night. I forgot how great that show is. I want to watch the whole series through again.

On Sunday I found this really sweet 5 disc DVD player. It even had mic inputs so you could do karaoke cds on your TV. And it was only $60! Granted it's not a name brand or anything but it is nice to be able to watch 5 different shows on DVD without replacing discs. This is also the first DVD player I've owned, up until now I've used the XBOX or PS2 to watch movies.

Lastly, when I returned home from the funeral yesterday I got a package from Megan. We've been dating for about a month now and she sent me a teddy bear, a happy fun ball and a couple other things. On a scale of 1 to great, she is super-awesome!
