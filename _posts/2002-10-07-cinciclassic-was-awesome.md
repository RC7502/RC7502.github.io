The title sums up everything. This was one of the best weekends ever! I got the email yesterday saying there were around 1,000 people combined at the two day event! I have never seen a person more addicted and obsessed with Bemani based games until I met Dan!!! He had a Japanese PS2 with every Beatmania, Drummania, Guitar Freaks, DDR, Keyboardmania and Para Para Paradise and their respective controllers made by the game manufacturer itself Konami. I believe him to be my future self as he was also a Macintosh user and even owned a G4 Cube!!!

Dan ran all the big tourney's for the event and I lost in round 2 of the Baku Baku tourney, got second with Dan in the Bomberman tourney, and got 1st in the DDR tourney! I bought a few games while I was there and even played a few rounds of DDR at the local arcade in the mall which featured DDRMAX2 for $.75 for a double credit amd 5 songs!! Well I'll touch on how the booth went, how the other Bemani rythm games were and more about how much I loved this event on Thursday but for now....
