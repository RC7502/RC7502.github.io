Last week I got a new motherboard and processor to put in my machine. Once I got them installed and hit the power switch nothing happened. I picked up a new case and power supply for my new machine and yet the motherboard still won't work. So now I am left with sending back the new motherboard and putting my old computer back together. There is actually a much longer version of this story which includes all the problems I've went through trying to get this thing to work. Nevertheless I did get my old machine up and running and should have some comics and the t-shirt winners this week. If anyone is working on a guest comic for BiTSMACK you can still submit one anytime.
