Walmart's in-store special for Saturday <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=1026142">features a $100 gift card with the purchase of a PS3</a>. More interesting to me is the Sanyo 46" TV for $800 or the Compaq laptop for $300, but I'm sure there are a couple of people out there that hasn't bought a PS3 wait. They've been waiting in their homes, playing their Xbox 360 and Wii, just biding their time.
