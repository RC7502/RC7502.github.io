I've got a 46" HDTV which is pretty cool 98% of the time. It even has this picture by picture thing where you can watch two things at once. The problem is only <strong>one</strong> of those pictures can be from a component input. My cable box, XBOX 360 and Wii are all component input. This means I can't watch TV while playing a video game at the same time. Granted if I could put both pictures side by side it would look pretty sucky and neither one would be utilizing the TV's ability to it's fullest potential. It seems to me I just want to consume two forms of entertainment simultaneously so that I can most efficiently use my free time in the evening.

The Hardest Thing In My Life is not being able to watch TV while playing video games.
