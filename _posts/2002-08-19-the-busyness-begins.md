Man the weekend was great, played DDR with RC friday, ate pizza, got food posioning Saturday, went to columbus and Easton Sunday. 
<br />

<br />
I played a LOT of DDR this weekend. I think I totalled about 6 or 7 hours. From being at home to playing at Gameworks it was a lot of fun! I cleared "Can't Stop Falling in Love (Speed K Mix)", "Drop Out", "Burning Heat", "Ecstasy" and "Super Star" all on Double Maniac @ Easton. At home I finished all the 5th mix songs on Single Maniac. Man this was a great weekend for my DDR fettish!

Aside from that I've been working to no end. I've got plenty to do with school starting in 8 days. I've got images to make and so far they haven't worked, and the first one HAS to be done today! Luckily our Apple SE was in and he helped me out a bit. Maybe I will make my deadline! :-D
<br />

<br />
I'm really not holding my breath but I have a full day of junk to do today so I don't think I'll be doing much else. (aside from reviews and the non-stop eating and drinking brought to me by computer life)
<br />

<br />
Have fun ya'll and remember to make the most out of everyday you live b/c some ppl will never get the opportunity that you have lying right in front of you. That's what I've learned this weekend.
