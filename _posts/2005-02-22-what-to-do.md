When I first got my job I was applying for a programmer position that I wasn't qualified for. In the interview they said they needed a consultant and that down the road I might be able to program. At the time I thought it was BS but I needed the job and consulting isn't bad. It's been two years and I am now starting to get some programming projects to work on. I just got one last week that is going to pay me a lot of money but I have to work on it after normal work hours. This makes it harder for me to get comics done during the week. <br />
<br />
So I am trying to figure out what to do. I don't want to stop doing the comic completely but I might have to change the schedule for awhile. I think I'm going to try to get two comics done on the weekend so I don't have to worry through the week. I'll try it this Friday and see what I can get done.<br />
<br />
<b>Update:</b> I'll make you a deal. Help me get a Mac Mini or iPod Shuffle and I will do all the comics you want. Go to one of these links:<br />

<a href=http://www.FreeiPodShuffle.com/?r=15463484>http://www.FreeiPodShuffle.com/?r=15463484</a><br />
<br />
For every person that signs up for one of these offers I will do a comic. When I get all 10 referrers for the Mac Mini I will do 3 comics a week for a month. A lot of these offers don't cost anything, you can just sign up and then cancel later.
