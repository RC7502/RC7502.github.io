Between being sick the last two days and packing for my move later this month, I haven't got any comics done. Updates are going to be sparce for the next month or so. In the meantime I've hopefully got some people lined up to do guest comics. Once again, if you want to do a guest comic for Bitsmack just send it to <a href="mailto:comics@bitsmack.com">comics@bitsmack.com</a>
