It makes sense that as time progresses toys would get cooler and cooler. However, at some point in the 90s everything kid related had to get wussified. Instead of army men carrying guns they started carrying walkie talkies to call their mommies for help. However, I decided this year to give toys another chance and write my Christmas list, if I was still 10.

1. <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3145296">Hasbro Nerf N Strike Vulcan EBF-25 Blaster</a>
<div style="float: none;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30855354@N05/3095237991"><img title="Not pictured: the carcasses of my enemies" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/3095237991_c4c7c55dab_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>
Back in the day, K-Dog and I had all kinds of Nerf guns to shoot at each other. I imagined that if an alien race ever invaded and their one weakness was compacted yellow foam (still more plausible than Signs) we would be ready to lead the resistance. Nowadays, Nerf is back with a dart gun that looks like the turrets in Halo 3. Totally awesome.

2. <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3092047">LEGO Star Wars: Ultimate Collector's Millennium Falcon</a>
<div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32840721@N03/3101872394"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/3101872394_4e3c2aba52.jpg" title="Don't tell me the odds (of me ever owning this)" width="284" height="192" /></a>

Combining Legos and Star Wars is a genius as combining candy and beer. This gigantic set takes things to a whole new level. Granted once you finally do put it together it's a little too big to fly around reenacting the asteroid scene from The Empire Strikes Back, but's it's the journey, not the destination that is the fun.

3. <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3295276&amp;isTopSellingItem=true">Guess Who: Star Wars Edition</a>

I didn't think it was possible to remake Guess Who with even fewer black people, but Hasbro found a way. The only potential downside to this game would be the more complicated questions that would come up:

Player 1: "Is your character on the dark side?"
Player 2: "In which movie?"
Player 1: "Ok, does your character start out innocent, but his fear turns him to the dark side where he resides for many years before redeeming himself just before his death with the help of his Jedi son?"
Player 2: "Nope."

4. <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3102977&amp;isTopSellingItem=true">Transformers Iron Man</a>
<div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8861003@N04/2835585340"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3090/2835585340_688fb5ee7b.jpg" title="Who new Iron Man was a Decepticon?" width="278" height="368" /></a>

The only possible way to make this cooler would be LEGO Transformers Iron Man.

So that's what I would want if I were 10 years old. Are there any other truly outrageous toys out there that I missed?
