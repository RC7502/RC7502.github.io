Hi All,<br />
<br />
In an effort to be less lazy (and to get all these pic off my phone) I am publishing my photos of the Bitsmack podcast from the Tiger release in my <a href="http://kruton6.textamerica.com">moblog.</a> The pics were taken using my Treo 650.<br />
<br />
Happy Smacking,<br />
K-dog
