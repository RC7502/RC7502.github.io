I'll be the first to admit, there are several people in this world with tougher lives than mine. I see people with problems on TV all the time and I can only assume television is an accurate reflection of what is going on in reality. When I think about the problems I deal with I realize that I have it pretty good. That's why I'm starting a new segment called "The Hardest Thing In My Life." 

I bought a PSP <a href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2008/03/04/you-down-with-psp-yeah-you-know-me/">about a week or so ago</a> with the aspiration of being able to <a href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2008/03/06/portable-education/">copy my UMDs to memory card</a> so I wouldn't have to carry around discs everywhere. I went online and bought a 4GB memory stick on ebay and an 8GB from an online retailer. However when the memory sticks arrived, neither one of them worked properly. After doing some research on the Interblag I discovered that fake Sony memory sticks have become more plentiful than rabbits on Funky Cold Medina. These fake sticks have all the same Sony writing on them and are indistinguishable from real ones, until you try using them. After spending a few hours trying different tricks (apparently only for kids) I finally decided to give up and send them back. My saving throw on online shopping came up snake eyes so now I'll have to shell out some extra money and buy from a real store. 

The Hardest Thing In My Life is buying fake Sony memory cards by mistake.
