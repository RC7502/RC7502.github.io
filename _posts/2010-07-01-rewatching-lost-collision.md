Oh great an Ana Lucia episode. If you'll excuse me I'm going to go leave the room for 45 minutes. 

On the island: Ana Lucia is a cop that should be put behind a desk because she's a psychopath.
Off the island: Ana Lucia should be put to sleep because she's a psychopath. 

The only redeeming value of this episode is seeing Rose and Bernard and Jin and Sun reunited. 

Ashley's note: She wonders why anyone listens to Ana Lucia when she is so clearly unstable. She takes back every mean thing she said about Shannon, Ana Lucia is way worse. When she sees Ana Lucia on screen she gets the "Kyle's Mom is a Bitch" song stuck in her head.
