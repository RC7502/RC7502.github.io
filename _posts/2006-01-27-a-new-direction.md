I have been using Flash for almost two years now and even though it was painful at first, I love the program now. I have started playing around with the animation features and I'm working on a short little cartoon. All of the sound and music editing is being done in Garageband. I'll still do the comic from time to time like I am doing now. I like taking on new projects. I figure if I can't be good at one thing, at least suck at many different things.
