Ahhhh, I'm back after a full tuesday of all three special extended editions of LOTR and the final chapter RotK. It was a magical night as Kim, David, Edwin, Russell (from work), two of his friends and I journeied to the mystical theatres of Maumee to embark on this epic struggle between good and evil. after spending 12+ hours in a theatre I was ready for bed.
<br />

<br />
In other news I will be back in K-town as of next week until Jan 2nd when we resume work. I haven't played as many games as I hoped to during break but I have a VERY good reason for that ;)
<br />
(I hope Kim figures out I'm talking about her) =D
