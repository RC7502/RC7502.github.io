Well, <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=411>see you in the fall!</a>

I thought the Friends finale was pretty good overall. I was glad they brought back the chick and the duck. The scenes with Joey and Chandler were my favorite because they reminded me of when they used to live together. I was sad that they had to destroy the foosball table though. The Ross and Rachel thing was dragged out way to long. Everyone knew they would end up together, it doesn't matter how many times you make Rachel get on and off the plane. And then at the end they all leave the apartment and go out for coffee one last time. I thought that was a good way to end it. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040507.png' alt'' />
