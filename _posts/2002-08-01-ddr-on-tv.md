Brace yourselves!! First DDR was featured in an episode of King of the Hill on FOX and now a Sketchers commercial?!? I was sitting here by my cube and heard cool music and looked up just in time to see someone dancing on a DDR machine and the words SKETCHERS on the screen!! If I see this again or any more info I'll post it since I am the DDR Freak of Bitsmack.
