<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=302>Last week</a> went by quick. But now K-Dog and I are back.
<br />

<br />
I'll let K-Dog talk about the WWDC, I on the other hand had a great time at Lakeside church camp. I should be able to get the film developed and post the pictures this week. 
<br />

<br />
Also, today is the last day to order the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=94>Legolas Pro Skater</a> t-shirt. I'll announce the next <a href=http://www.cafepress.com/bitsmack>comic of the month t-shirt</a> tomorrow.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030630.gif' alt'' />
