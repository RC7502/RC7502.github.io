Some foreign dude wants Jack to recreate the same miracle he had fixing his wife. Meanwhile Michael takes off to find Walt. 

On the island: Jack tries to bring back Michael to fix everything. 
Off the island: Jack's wife leaves him because he's always trying to fix everything.

We get to see Mr. Friendly again for the first time since the boat. We find out there are a lot more Others than originally expected. At the end of the episode Jack asks Ana Lucia how to train an army. Well I guess if you're coming up with a crazily stupid plan you should go to the craziliest stupid person on the island. 

Ashley's note: She wants to know if that one Other is Vincent from Beauty and the Beast.
