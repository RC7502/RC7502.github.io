Hi everybody.
<br />
I've been gone a long time but I'm going to make a semi-return today.  I've been doing a lot of work lately and it makes me scarcely at a computer when I get off work. 
<br />

<br />
Things I want to do:
<br />
The fate of Bitsmack has not been determined yet.  It's turning as into more of a community site and comic land for most and there have been questions as to why we're still doing the reviews thing.
<br />

<br />
Things I promise to continue to do:
<br />
1) Be a part of the site.
<br />
So long as Russ doesn't axe me off the admin list I will be a part of the site as much as I can.  If you knew what I go through in a day you'd understand why I'm never around.
<br />
2) Rhythm game "stuff"
<br />
As long as I am a part of this site it will have to interest me in the realm of rhythm games.  I want to "improve" the db as much as possible by adding AS much as the server can hold.
<br />
3) Influence the next phase of Bitsmack.
<br />
I want to help out with RC's work on the site and hopefully guide him to what I hope will be a fun experience for all.
<br />

<br />
Furthermore, I'm going to try and work on the site a bit tonight and hopefully clear up some more rgdb's info and someday complete the collection as well as a possible sim info section.
<br />

<br />
Peace,
<br />
K-dog
