If you want to help us out with the Columbus Geeks Charity you can find information on how to donate at  <a href=http://www.columbusgeekscharity.org>ColumbusGeeksCharity.org.</a> Tomorrow morning Brad will be promoting the charity on <a href=http://tvulive.com/radiou/riot.htm>88.7 RadioU.</a> If you aren't local you can still listen to the interview online or it'll probably be in their archive later. We've received lots of donations already. It's weird to come home and find video games in the mail that you can't play, but its all for a good cause. There's not much time left so donate today! <i>Doooo itttt!</i> (shakes fist)<br />

In other news, I'm don't normally brag about how well I do in a video game but last night I had one of the greatest comebacks in poker history. I was playing World Championship Poker on XBOX Live. I was in a tournament with five other people and we each started with $1000 of chips. I lost some big hands early in the game and was in last place with less than $200. I went "all in" three times in a row and either won or got the other people to fold. This got me above $1000 and the first guy went out. I started playing a lot tighter and folding most hands. One of the hands I folded was really big and two people got knocked out. This left three of us. One of those people was pretty low and I think they just quit. So it was down to me and the chip leader and he had about three times my number of chips. I was getting some mediocre hands but so was he and I was able to bluff quite a bit. On one hand my Ace pair beat his pair and the balance of power shifted in my favor. I kept whittling him down to the point that the blinds were really high and any bet would put him all in. When I finally beat him I was simply shocked that I had come back from that far behind. Even though this poker game isn't the greatest it is really good practice and I am starting to see mistakes I am making.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20041209.png' alt'' />
