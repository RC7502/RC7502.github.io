Greetings all, from the dorm room of the great K-dogg as he gives you the 411 on .hack//Infection, the D-town DDR tourney, being snowed in at D-town and creating "Hardcore DWI" where <A HREF="http://groovemaster.livejournal.com">Ben</a> feels everyone's pain, the new Disturbed album, the upcoming "See Spot Rock" tour this Friday, and Xenosaga coming out this week.
<br />

<br />
1st let's kick things off with my follow-up on <A HREF="http://www.dothack.com">.hack//Infection</a>. This is a so-called "Simulated MMORPG" for those of you who were confused by my earlier post. Unfortunately I beat the game in three days which cost me a total of 16 hours. The plus side however, results in a storyline that continues on the the next game, .hack//Mutation which will be coming out in May. The entire game series is coming out 3 months apart from each other and another plus is that not only do you keep all your items and levels, I've played 5 hours past the ending!! The game actually contains a reason to play after unlike the FF series. 
<br />
Since beating the game and watching the second anime series DVD that came with the game entitled .hack//Liminity I HAD to download all the episodes from Japan. I managed to find three series called .hack//Sign and had 26 episodes, .hack//Liminity with 3 episodes, and .hack//Dusk containing 6 episodes. Keep in mind these were the episodes I could find, there may in fact be more episodes out there and all the episodes were subbed so I had to sit through interesting Japanese talking amongst characters. The Sign series happens in 2005, the game and Liminity series happen in 2007 and run parrallel and Dusk happens sometime after the game. I'm addicted!!

MOVING ON
<br />

<br />
The D-town DDR tourney was on Saturday and began at 2pm. Unfortunately we were stuck running it on one pad, b/c the UP arrow on the other pad didn't work. We ran it double elim, one song. High seed gets to pick difficulty and when to go, low seed picked song. We ran a qualifier on Twilight Zone Standard (Trick) from DDRMAX. I managed to get top seed with all perfects and 5 GREATs, with Bill right behind me at 6 GREATs. I played Steve from D-town, killed him, then went up against Jon who had gotten a LOT better since the last time I saw him! He picked "It's Raining Men" and I chose Maniac. Stupid move, he killed me. I dropped to the losers bracket. Bill played Chris on Healing Vision ~Angelic Mix~ and Bill picked Maniac. Bill was now in the losers bracket with me. Since I was in the losers bracket I met up with Jon again. I don't remember what he picked but I won. Next the moment I had been expecting had come.... I was up against Bill. He chose Max 300 (the sin of DDR) so to mess him up bad I chose the only thing I had a chance at... BASIC. I ended up winning and went up against Chris. 
<br />
FINAL ROUND: Me vs. Chris, 3 songs (His pick, my pick, and Roulette)
<br />
His pick "DXY!", He won
<br />
My pick "Can't Stop Fallin in Love (Speed K Mix)", I Won
<br />
Roulette "Dive To The Night", he won.
<br />
Final Standings went like this:
<br />
Chris
<br />
Me
<br />
Bill
<br />
Jon
<br />
KC
<br />

<br />
Freestyle Blew, I made up as I went along like norm and picked "Absolute" I ended up losing to some people, who if both pads had been working probably would have failed their double freestlyes.
<br />

So you're on the keyboard playing one of the many DDR simulators, BORING!!!

Try this, have a friend stand behind you and smack you in the head for every GOOD or below you get. In no time you'll be "AA"ing songs like a pro!

LAST TOPIC
<br />

<br />

FINAL THOUGHTS
<br />

<br />
Support Bemani or it might not make it. To everyone who thinks DDR is gay, grow up, try it and if everyone hates you for it, I'll respect you a little bit more for taking part in what has become a huge impact on my life. It's good for losing weight, coordination, and rhythm. The current standings for Bemani games has DDR in last place according to my source into Japanese culture. Pop n music is 1st, then Drummania, and then Beatmania IIDX with Beatmania, Para Para Paradise, and Guitar Freaks somewhere down there.
<br />
Dan is the coolest guy because he got me into all these Japanese Rythm games that hardly exist in America but are all the rave in Japan. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't have the "Tub of Fun" containing all my rythm games and accessories. I hope someday you get that Beatmania IIDX and DDR machines for your house man. Finally I would like to thank all the readers, contributers, proprietors, fans, and addicts of Bitsmack. You ALL make this site what it is in one way or another. Keep in touch everyone
<br />

K-dogg out!!
