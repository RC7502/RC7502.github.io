There's a new <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=289>horror writer</a> in town.
<br />

<br />
Last night the <a href=http://www.devryguyz.com>Devryguyz</a> and I did another episode of Bitsmack LIVE. You can download it in the Downloads section. It was raw, uncut, unsensored video game discussion. I've had time to rethink my top 5 favorite games of all time and they are as follows:
<br />
1. Goldeneye
<br />
2. Doom II
<br />
3. Beatmania IIDX
<br />
4. Chrono Cross
<br />
5. Super Mario 64
<br />

<br />
In other news I finally got Keyboardmania yesterday. It's funny that no matter how good at rhythm games I think I am, I always suck at a new one the first time. A long time ago I used to play piano but with this game I have no idea where to put my hands. It's a pretty cool game though and I look forward to playing it some more.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030528.gif' alt'' />
