The second day we went to the Magic Kingdom. We didn't have the park hopper option so the plan was to hit four parks in four days with two extra days to go back to anything we missed. It was cloudy but not raining when we went to the park in the morning. We got a few pictures in and some rides before it started pouring. I had to buy ponchos which ended up staying with us at all times the rest of the week. Next I'll list all the things we did and my rating of awesomeability. They aren't necessarily in the order we did them, I'm not some kind of remembering machine.

<strong>Monster's Inc. Laugh Floor
</strong>This was supposed to be a comedy show with a little interaction from the audience. It had a few laughs but wasn't as funny as another attraction I'll talk about when we get to Epcot. What I can't figure out is how the comedians ad-libbed and still had it match up with the animated characters on the screen. I give it a 3 out of 5.

<strong>Stitch's Escape
</strong>This is in the same location as the Alien Encounter attraction that I went on when I was at Disney in 1996. The inside was all the same except the story was changed to be about Stitch. It was more funny than scary now. I also give it a 3 out of 5. It was enjoyable but not something I needed to do a second time.

<strong>Buzz Lightyear Ride
</strong>This was a fun ride where you sit in a car for two and shoot targets with a light gun as the ride progresses. The only downside was that it was hard to see where you were actually shooting because it would show a red dot but you don't know if that's your red dot or your partners or someone from another car. Ashley and I rode this one twice and bought the picture of us at the end. We look all serious with our laser guns. There is one better shooting ride and that was the Toy Story ride at Hollywood Studios, but we'll get to that later. I give Buzz's ride a 4 out of 5.

<strong>Carousel of Progress</strong>
Apparently this show was all the rage in the 1960s where it has a robot family talk about what life is like during different decades leading up to the 60s. The problem is it jumps from the 50s to what seems like the 90s, but it is supposed to represent today. This is a great age we live in with our Laserdisc players, virtual reality helmets and voice activated ovens. Go on this ride if there is no line and get a good laugh. 2 out of 5.

<strong>Mad Hatter's Tea Cup Ride</strong>
There are tea cups and they spin around, not much more to it than that. Ashley and I discovered if we just focused on each other we could get it spinning really fast and not get sick. 5 out of 5.

<strong>Dumbo's Ride</strong>
Pretty tame ride, just goes around in a circle and up and down. The Magic Carpet Ride and Astro Orbiter are almost identical but at least the Astro Orbiter is up high. 2 out of 5.

<strong>Peter Pan's Ride</strong>
This is a good ride for kids and basically takes you through the story of Peter Pan. 3 out of 5.

<strong>It's a Small World</strong>
This was my favorite ride when I was five and it looks like it hasn't changed since. Oh, but this brings me to a new topic, people who video tape rides. Almost every ride and attraction I saw someone videotaping the whole thing. It's not technically against the rules as long as they have the light off but it was still annoying. And what is the point anyway? Are these people really sitting around one night saying "hey let's go watch the small world ride again". Is it really worth lessening your enjoyment and the enjoyment of those around you so that you can have a crappy quality video of a ride later? Anyway Small World gets a 3 out of 5.

<strong>Mickey's Philarmagic</strong>
This was by far my favorite show, and Ashley and I watched it twice. It is a 3D movie where Donald is chasing after Mickey's sorcerer hat and ends up in different Disney movies. It has songs from The Little Mermaid, Lion King, Peter Pan and more. I would say that it is a "must do" attraction and one of my favorites of the whole trip. 5 out of 5.

<strong>Pinocchio's House
</strong>This is where we ate our quick service lunch. The problem was with the rain and it being lunch time the place was packed and you basically had to stalk people until one of them gave up their table. It was actually like this at almost all the quick service places at lunch time. My advice is eat your lunch at an off hour or eat your sit down meal for lunch.

<strong>Haunted Mansion</strong>
I think Ashley was a little scared to go on this one, but I told her it was just like the Quicker Stop in the Clerks cartoon. She asked if it did any drops or anything and I said no. Then in my mind I was thinking "well it might I don't remember". But it didn't. 4 out of 5.

<strong>Country Bear Jamboree
</strong>Hee Haw with robot bears. 2 out of 5.

<strong>Pirates of the Caribbean
</strong>This ride changed a lot from what I remember. They added Jack Sparrow like 3 different places and I thought there was a lot more pirate drinking and partying in the old one. 4 out of 5.

<strong>Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse
</strong>Do kids even know what the Swiss Family Robinson is? That was before my time even. Anyway you can walk around the treehouse, it's nothing too spectacular. 1 out of 5.

<strong>Enchanted Tiki Room
</strong>This wasn't on our list of attractions we really wanted to see but it was pouring so we went inside. Basically there are a bunch of robot birds hanging from the ceiling and they sing songs. The red bird from Aladdin and the bird from The Lion King show up. It was better than I thought it would be. 3 out of 5.

<strong>Snow White's Scary Adventures</strong>
This ride wasn't scary at all. It's just like the Peter Pan ride except with the story of Snow White. 3 out of 5.

<strong>Tom Sawyer's Island
</strong>This place was kinda cool. Hardly anyone was there. Basically it is an island with a few old shacks on it and a cave. If you want to get away from the crowds for awhile check this out and get some breathing room. 2 out of 5.

<strong>Conclusion
</strong>I was disappointed Space Mountain was closed because it was my favorite ride last time. The Hall of Presidents was also closed. We had our sit down meal at Tony's Town Square. It's modeled after the Italian restaurant in Lady and the Tramp. Ashley and I shared a plate of spaghetti and meatballs. I nudged one of the meatballs over to her side with my nose. Then we started eating the same noodle until we kissed. Oh wait, that was the movie, not us.

Once dinner was over it stopped raining just in time for the Spectromagic parade and fireworks. After the fireworks I got down on one knee and proposed to Ashley. She said yes.
