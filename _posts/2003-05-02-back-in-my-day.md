Last night the Devryguyz, Goz and I went and saw X2. My short review: awesome. I think it almost surpasses Spider-Man as the best comic book based movie. I think I actually want to go see it again it is so good. Even the previews were good, I got to see a longer Hulk trailer and of course Matrix Reloaded. There was also a trailer for The League of Extrodinary Gentlemen. I'm not familar with the comic book it's based on, but the movie looks incredible. I'll post more on X2 later, after more people have seen it.
