The French chick shows up to tell Claire her baby is sick. Everyone talks about how crazy she is but she is right about some things.

On the island: Claire regains her memories of where Ethan took her in Season 1 and wants to go back there because Aaron is sick.
Flashback: When Claire was in the medical hatch Ethan gave her shots and had a nursery set up.

We get to see Mr. Friendly without his fake beard and some of the medical hatch. We also get to see Alex for the first time. I don't really know if we get an answer of why Ethan was shooting her up with stuff or why pregnant woman can't give birth on the island.
