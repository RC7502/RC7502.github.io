<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=93>Today's comic</a> is not on my resume.

<br />
I've been doing a lot of job searching online. Haven't heard anything back yet. When I'm not searching I'm usually playing Beatmania. Other than that mot much is going on. I heard rumors that Christmas is next week. If this is true, I am not prepared. I have also heard rumors of a possible party at K-Dog's for New Years. Maybe he could clear up these rumors if he ever decided to post on this site again. I'd say he's been busy but now that finals are over he should have less to do than me.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20021218.jpg' alt'' />
