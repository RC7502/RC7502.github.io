Hello all and Happy Thanksgiving.
<br />
I just want to take this time to let everyone know this holiday season that Metroid Prime is incredible!! At first I was like, "Yeah this is pretty great" and then as I watched Extended Play on TechTV yesterday that the game is more than great and scored a perfect 5 out of 5 as did it's brother Metroid Fusion on the GBA!! So then I started looking through my latest issue of EGM and saw that it is THE GAME and scored a perfect 10 from all the reviewers there!!! So in my opinion, GAME OF THE YEAR!
<br />

<br />
Also on a rather serious and sad note, I have begun preparing for my next console purchase.... the xbox :(
<br />
Mechassult, DOA Beach Volleyball (Jan 15th), Halo, Toe Jam and Earl 3, and Gunvalkarie. They finally have some games I want.
<br />

<br />
Lastly I just have to say to Goz, told ya so!! You'll just have to buy a top loader :)
<br />

<br />
Have a good Thanksgiving
<br />
K-dogg out!!
