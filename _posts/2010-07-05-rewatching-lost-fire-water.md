Charlie is having a dream about Christmas when he is a kid. English accents sound so cool, I hope Ashley and I have British kids some day. Charlie's brother is playing with the same original Voltron toy I had as a child. Is the Defender of the Universe somehow linked to the island? I hope so!

On the island: Charlie has dreams that tell him he has to baptize Aaron.
Off the island: Charlie's brother finally cleans up and quits the band.

There's a moment when Hurley and Libby are in the hatch and Libby wonders why the washer and dryer are newer than everything else. This is funny because when this season started originally a lot of people online were asking that same question. So this is Lost's way of acknowledging the message boards without actually answering the question. Other than this there isn't much island mythology in this episode.  Best lines of the episode:

Sawyer to Hurley (sees Libby carrying laundry to the hatch): Well go on, I'm sure you got a load you need to drop in. 

Ashley's note: She thinks it's crap that Charlie's brother sold Charlie's piano for money to go home.
