The <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=68>comic</a> is up.

In the upcoming weeks there will be a lot of cool new games released, but right now there isn't much that is noteworthy. Kruton is getting his Japanese PS2 this week so I look forward to playing DDRMAX. Also, the movie Jackass is coming out on Friday and I have to be there. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20021021.gif' alt'' />
