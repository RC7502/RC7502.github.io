Kevin Smith is a fascinating guy but other than sleeping and taking a dump I can't do anything for five hours straight. <span class="asinTitle"><span id="btAsinTitle">Sold Out: A Threevening With Kevin Smith is the third DVD release of Kevin Smith Q &amp; As. This one takes place on his 37th birthday in New Jersey. </span></span>

I will start this review with one word of advice, <strong>fast-forward through the entire first hour</strong>. I don't care how much in love with Kevin Smith you are. You could be the biggest Kevin Smith superfan that has ever walked the Earth and still not find one interesting/funny thing that happens in the first hour. Not one tee-hee-hee. If you still don't believe me, here is what you would miss. Smith starts out talking about how it's his birthday and how he is named after Saint Kevin, who apparently did some really weird stuff. I didn't time this section but it goes on way too long. At one point I finally realized we hadn't even had one question asked yet. Then we finally get the first question: has he ever thought about doing a kids movie? Fair question. The short answer is no, but the long answer takes up the rest of the first hour. Smith starts talking about the latest dog they bought, then he goes back and talks about how they got their original dogs, then he goes further back and talks about having cats as a kid. I think it is a universal truth that <strong>no one cares about pet stories</strong>. This isn't just about Kevin Smith it applies to anyone. I don't care if you taught your dog to bring you a beer and bark "I ruv roo", if you are talking to me and start a story with "my dog did the cutest thing" I'm going to nod and smile, but in my head I'm going to be singing the Super Mario Bros. 2 theme and thinking about which X-Men comics I should read next. I am not alone in this thought as the shots of the audience showed them to be just as bored as I was.

<strong>But all is not lost! </strong>Once the second question hits, things get moving in the right direction. Smith starts talking about making Clerks II and how much fun him and Jason Mewes had. Other stories include Hayden Christensen getting pissed about the Clerks II trailer and what Kevin Smith thought about Superman Returns.

Overall I think this DVD suffers from the same dilemma that Evening 2 had. Since all the footage is taken from one Q&amp;A there is less comic gold to be mined. What made the first Evening so incredible is that it came from many different Q&amp;As and the way it was edited kept the funny stories coming in rapid succession. I'll be watching the second disc this week and will post my review afterward.

Stay tuned!
