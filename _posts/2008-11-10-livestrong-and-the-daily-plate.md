I've been running for three years now. In the first year I lost about 30 pounds, but in the last two I have stayed about the same despite training for and running marathons. The reason I haven't lost any more weight is because I've been eating whatever and whenever I want. I've tried tracking my calories before but it just became too time consuming until I found this site:

<a href="http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate" target="_blank">http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate</a>

This is the best online food journal I have used, and I have tried many of them. There are two things that set this one apart. The first is that entering what you ate is super quick and simple. Since anyone can submit foods, all the major restaurants and brand names are already in the database. The second is that it deducts calories for the exercise I do. So if my target calories are 1200 for the day and I run enough to burn 400 calories, I can eat 1600 that day. This keeps me motivated to work out more because then I can eat more.

If you want to lose weight I recommend trying out this site for a couple weeks. Just the process of tracking what you eat every meal is going to subconsciously keep you from eating as much.
