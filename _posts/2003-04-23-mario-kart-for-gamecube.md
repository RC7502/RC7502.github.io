<a href=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/driving/supermariokartworkingtitle/news_6025528.html>Gamespot </a> has put up the first screens and info for a new Mario Kart game. This time each kart has 2 characters, one to drive and one to use weapons. I for one am skeptical whenever a sequel to a great game is changed drastically in gameplay. Nintendo could have just made Mario Kart with better graphics and I'd still like it. The article also lists the charcters that will be in the game. I for one think Waluigi is just creepy. I mean honestly, what do we know about this guy's past?
