<a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/27/1355224&tid=207">Slashdot</a> has and article up about using the PSP for web browsing. There is an imbeded web browsing capability that isnt a feature yet. The article calls for setting up a DNS server and such, but there is an easier way.<br />
<br />
Go to Network settings on the PSP, and make a new connection. Set it up just like your local area connection but set the DNS Server as 67.171.70.72<br />
<br />
Then load up Wipeout Pure and hit download, select the new connection and your web browsing with your PSP. :)<br />
