A lot has happened lately.  The biggest news being that I have two arcade machines coming and should be here before the end of the month going into Club 180.  A Para Para Paradise 2nd Mix and Beatmania Core Remix machine.  They will be set on $.50 a play and I have been given a key for access to run the club whenever I want to.  Now that I have these machines after they get paid off I will probably be purchasing more machines to store at the club for the people to play with.

I've been spending a lot of time finishing up my skoolwork because I have exams next week.  One good start is that I have only one exam that I actually have to goto a classroom for.  The rest are online or I do not have to take them. :)

I hope to be more proactive with bitsmack in the future with summer coming along :)

That's it for now,
