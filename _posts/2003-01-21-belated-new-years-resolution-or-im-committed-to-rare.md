You know, I've been saying, "No New Years Resolutions for me" and then I got to thinking, what about a video game new years resolution, so here's what I've come up with:
<br />

<br />
1. Hate EA Less
<br />

<br />
Reasoning: When you go into a video games store and look at all the games for the different gaming platforms, what is the label you see most often?? 
<br />
Rockstar, Squaresoft, Sega, Nintendo?? No of course not, it's EA. Some of us remember them as the gang who bought out the 007 licensing from the beloved Rare and flushed it down the toilet a couple of times by pumping out AS MANY 007 TITLES AS THEY COULD!! If a game has one new gun and changed the maps slightly IT DOES NOT COUNT AS A NEW GAME!!! Has anyone checked out Nightfire yet??? The so called, "Closest thing to Goldeneye they've produced" Well let me tell you, the guns were taken almost DIRECTLY OUT OF PERFECT DARK!!!
<br />
Why does EA have so many games they've published and produced?? Hmmm, let's see:
<br />
They own their cybornetic monster Will Wright, creator of "The Sims" They've been making sports games that go wwwaaaaayyyyy back, They are now a part of Westwood, Squaresoft, <A HREF="http://www.ea.com/global/legal/legalnotice.jsp">and a bunch of other stuff.</a> In fact, of the 7 games my roomate has sitting out, 4 of them are EA titles!!! Well I could go on for days on this so I'll maybe do that later.
<br />

<br />
2. Stay dedicated to Rare.
<br />

<br />
Reasoning: While Nintendo has sold Rare to Microsoft, I am now an Xbox owner (some battles just can't be won) and that entitles me to be able to play MANY sweet games from Sega and Rare. (please note that while I own an xbox, my intentions are to gain titles Sega, Rare, and Konami have only released on this console)
<br />
I just can't wait until Perfect Dark 2 :)
<br />

<br />
3. Love Squaresoft
<br />

<br />
Reasoning: Several titles are expected to be released this year including FFTA for GBA, FFX-2 for PS2, more exclusive FF Japanese titles being converted to our language, and possibly a Kingdom Hearts sequel or movie (I just saw the SPECIAL ending and don't know what it means)
<br />

<br />
4. Get better at Bemani games
<br />

<br />
Reasoning: I'm up to 10 foot DDR tunes and 5 star IIDX songs on 7 Key, while I'm like a king at PPP.
<br />

<br />
Well I'll have another post for Tuesday, lata
<br />

<br />
K-dogg out!!
