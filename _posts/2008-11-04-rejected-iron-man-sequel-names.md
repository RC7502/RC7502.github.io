Rejected names for the upcoming Iron Man sequels include <span style="font-style: italic;">Iron Man 2: The Wrath of Obidiah</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Iron Man 3: The Search for Scotch</span>.<br /><br />And if you've only watched it on DVD, be sure to check out the scene that happens after the credits. A friend of mine has only seen it on DVD and had never let the credits finished. Speaking of scenes at the end of the credits, there is also one on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</span>.<br />
