You have already decided whether or not to read <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=285>today's comic.</a> You just need to figure out why you made that choice.

The Matrix Reloaded is two movies in one! You have an action movie with pretty cool special effects, then you also have an hour long psudo-psychology lecture. These two movies really have no relationship with one another. I enjoyed the movie and want to see it again, but I think it was way too preachy at times. What do you think?
