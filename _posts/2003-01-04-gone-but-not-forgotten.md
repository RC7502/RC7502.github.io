I have escaped the treacherous dungeons of the evil empire of my new Microsoft Xbox for a brief period to type this news info. 
<br />

<br />
So I now have all 4 next gen consoles as well as 14 of the 16 other consoles this website covers.
<br />

<br />
As a new xbox owner over the past 8 days I have already acquired 7 games as well as 3 others on the way from my good pal ebay. Otherwise I have 5 games on GC and a bunch on the PS2 and Japanese PS2.
<br />

<br />
In other news, the cartoon <A HREF="http://www.undergrads.tv">UnderGRADS</a> is awesome and it's not been settled wether the show will make it another season. MTV and TELEtoon (canadian) are the origninal right holders but MTV has dropped the show. Teletoon has agreed to another season but if they do not get another American sponsor, the second season will not happen. The show can currently be seen on Comedy Central Sunday and Wednesday nights around 1:30am (i think)
<br />

<br />
On a Bemani note, I WILL be participating in the DDR tourney this Saturday. Of course I'll also be at the mall Friday night practicing. I'm also working hard at Beatmania IIDX and Para Para Paradise. 
<br />

<br />
And finally, I apoligize for my absence on the web scene. I have been away from school and the lack of a T1 line to do my bidding has kind of taken me away from my web antics. As of January 8th I will be back in school and will try to post at my regularly scheduled time and for special events. I will see you all later
