Snow day! Because of the level 2 snow emergency I decided to work from home. This meant I got to sleep a little more and made it easy to work out. Here are the results:

<strong>Sleep</strong>

I got a little bit better sleep, 65% efficiency. On the graphs I can see where I was tossing and turning at 4am.

<strong>Exercise</strong>

I have been following the <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/halfmarathon/inter.htm">Hal Higdon Intermediate Half Marathon Plan</a>. I don't officially start it till 2/9 but I have already been doing workouts from it. Today was interval training of five 400m at 7.6 mph, with jogging at 4 mph in between.

<strong>Diet</strong>

I had a Veggie Egg McMuffin using veggie sausage, an English muffin and a slice of cheese. It is very good. I had chicken nuggets for lunch and a chicken and biscuit meal for dinner. I had two chocolate chip cookies for dessert. I stuck to my new 1800 calories goal, only going over by 55.

<strong>Totals</strong>

Calories burned from GoWear Fit: 2152
Calories consumed from The Daily Plate: 1855
Difference: 297

I felt pretty good today. I wasn't overly starving but I didn't stuff myself either. I think I picked a good calorie goal and the real test will be this weekend. I'm only going to write a post every day for the first week I have this GoWear Fit device. After that I'll probably only update on a weekly basis.
