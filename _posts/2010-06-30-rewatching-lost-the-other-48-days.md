This is a good episode because it explains what happened to the tail section people. It opens with a cool shot of the tail of the plane crashing into the water. 

On the island: The Tail People get their asses kick from The Others, so they move into the jungle and find out an Other is among them. 

The kid at the beginning is holding the same bear we saw a couple episodes ago tied to an other. Does that mean it was the kids we saw? Now here's where I have a problem. They find Bernard stuck in a tree still buckled to his seat. He was in the back of the plane to use the bathroom, and his seat was in the front of the plane. So why would he be buckled in seat in the back? This episode is kind of like a Twilight Zone episode where everyone gets really suspicious and turns on each other. I really thought watching this again I would be more sympathetic of why Ana Lucia is such a bitch, but no I just don't like her. It's really bugging me that Jin still has a handcuff on his wrist. Didn't they have the key to unlock it when they handcuffed him back in season 1? How were they planning on getting it off then?

Ashley's note: Ana Lucia is not doing CPR right at the beginning of the episode. 
Me: Is that because she's not kicking the little girl's ass, because that is what Jack would do?
(Ashley tries to show me how to properly do CPR but I go back to playing Magic the Gathering on my PC).
