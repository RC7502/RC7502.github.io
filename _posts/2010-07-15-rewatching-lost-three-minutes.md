13 Days Ago, Michael steals a gun and heads out to find Walt. I don't know why Michael knocked out Locke first and then decided to go into the Dharma chatroom to argue about whether Kirk or Picard was a better captain. I would think it'd be better to do things the other way around.

On the island: Michael needs to get certain people to come to The Others
Flashbacks: Michael gets captured by The Others

I don't get why The Others wanted Walt. Isn't Ben supposedly working for Jacob at this point? It makes even less sense when we meet Miss Clue. I don't think we ever get an explanation on her but she asks Michael all these strange questions about whether Walt has ever been sick or showed up in weird places. I think it is dumb that Charlie throws all the heroin into the ocean. It could have had some use for medicinal purposes. When Michael finally gets to see Walt, Walt says they have been making him take tests. Also Miss Clue says something about putting him "back in the room". I wonder if it is that same room they used to brainwash people Clockwork Orange style. We're building to the finale, only 2 episodes left.

Ashley's note: She's glad that we got to see Walt is ok.
