We're back in the old gulf war and Sayid's troop is shredding all their documents and then the U.S. shows up.

On the island: Sayid tortures Henry Gale for information. 
Off the island: Sayid has to torture one of his own people to find a missing US pilot. 

Hey we get to see Ben for the first the time. Only when we first meet him he is claiming to be Henry Gale. We also see Kelvin for the first time working for the US Army. I have to say when I saw this the first time I didn't know if "Henry Gale" was really telling the truth or not. Watching this a second time, the French woman flat out tells Sayid that he is one of the Others. There's an awesome moment where Locke doesn't enter the numbers right away and the counter turns into red hieroglyphics. Also, in Kate's last flashback we saw Sayid on a TV screen. In this episode we find out Sayid met Kate's "dad."
 
Ashley's note: she doesn't like the torture scenes.
