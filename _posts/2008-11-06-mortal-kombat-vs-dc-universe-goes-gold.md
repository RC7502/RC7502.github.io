<a href="http://www.dailygame.net/news/archives/008518.php">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe Goes Gold for PS3, Xbox 360 -- DailyGame</a>
<blockquote>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe has gone gold today, Midway announced, putting the fighting game on track to ship for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on Nov. 16</blockquote>

<p>I'm hoping this is a pretty sweet game, but of course I won't get it until it drops to $20. :-) And I'm really curious how competitive Lex Luthor is going to be in a fighting game, he's never struck me as the physical type.
