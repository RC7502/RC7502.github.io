No I'm not talking about purple tights or Billy Zane, a new video game system is being released called the <a href=http://www.phantom.net>Phantom.</a> They are currently accepting applications to become a beta tester. Their site is interesting, you have to sit through a flash intro (that you can't skip). After that you'll find there are no specs or even pictures of the console, but you can buy hats and t-shirts.

I can picture it now, I'm struting down the street in my phantom t-shirt. "Hey dude, what's the phantom?" someone will ask. "I don't know, but its on my shirt" I'll reply.
