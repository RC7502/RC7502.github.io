I should start <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=468>patenting this stuff.</a><br />

I got a new laptop from Dell over the weekend. Using a <a href=http://www.slickdeals.net>Slick Deals</a> coupon I got a really good deal on it. Here are the specs for you nerds: 1.6GHz Pentium M, 1GB RAM, 15" widescreen, 60GB hard drive, 128MB ATI video card, CDRW/DVD drive. I thought it would be a good secondary machine but then after I installed Warcraft on it, it is going to be my main gaming machine. Warcraft looks so good on it I feel like I am playing a completely different game. Now the only thing that's next is getting a wireless keyboard a mouse for it so it is more comfortable playing games.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20050815.png'   />
