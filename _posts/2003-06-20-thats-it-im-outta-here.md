After <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=298>today's comic</a> I need a vacation.
<br />

<br />
I'm heading out of town on vacation all next week. I like having a week completely separated from my computer, cell phone and video games. K-Dog is gone next week too for the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=261>WWDC.</a> In the meantime, Goz will be here bringing you some new comics. This is the longest I've been away from the website since it started. It's kinda like leaving your pet at home. Hopefully Bitsmack won't crap all over the carpet while I'm gone.
<br />

<br />
In other news, this is your last week to get the <a href=http://www.cafeshops.com/bitsmack.2608095>Legolas Pro Skater</a> t-shirt. Starting in July the shirt will have a completely different comic.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030620.gif' alt'' />
