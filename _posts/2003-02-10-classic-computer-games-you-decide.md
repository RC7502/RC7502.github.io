A suggestion has been brought up in the <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=superbb&file=index>forums</a> that the Bitsmack reviews section should be expanded to include classic computer games. I've added a poll so that you can vote on whether you want classic computer games, all computer games or no computer games. Keep in mind that it would be impossible for me to get complete game lists for all these computers so it would be up to you to add a game to the database before you could review it. Let me know what you think, vote today!
