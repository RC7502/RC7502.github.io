The <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=257>new comic</a> is up.
<br />
<br />
Because of the drought in new video games I've decided to get out one of the classics: The Legend of Zelda, The Ocarina of Time. Instead of playing my Gamecube bonus disk I decided to get out the original because I never finished the game and I didn't want to start at the beginning. After about an hour trying to figure out where I was in the game I determined I actually only need to beat two more dungeons.

Last night K-Dog, the youth group and I went to the Relient K album release party/concert. It was a good time. I haven't listened to their new album yet but it will be hard to top their last one.

One last thing, we're still looking for comic nominations. So far we have 3. Even if you don't plan on buying a shirt you can still nominate a comic. I'm curious to see which ones are favorites. Click "comments" below.
