We open on a pretty intense scene where Sawyer as a little kid witnesses his father's murder/suicide. Then Sawyer wakes up on the island and chases an imaginary boar. 

On the island: Sawyer and Kate go after a boar that Sawyer thinks is out to get him.
Off the island: Sawyer gets tricked into killing the wrong man in Sydney.

Some nice continuity in this episode as Sawyer meets Christian Shepherd in a bar in Sydney. Christian even mentions forgetting his wallet which Jack found in the earlier episode. Michael is making some progress on the boat and Sayid helps Charlie try to get over killing Ethan. I mean who on this island HASN'T killed somebody?

Ashley's note: she likes Sawyer episodes but now she feels bad for him.
