Here's your present: <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=435>the biggest Bitsmack comic yet!</a><br />
<br />
It seems like Christmas has came out of nowhere, punched me in the gut and ran away. I have a couple more presents to wrap and I'm looking forward to exchanging gifts with my friends and family. Thursday I have to "work" until noon and then we have the company Christmas party. I hope I don't get snowed in and forced to stay home. Hmmm... I don't think my sarcasm was obvious enough in that last sentance. Oh well, MERRY CHRISTMAS everyone!<br />
<br />
That last one wasn't sarcastic, just in case you were confused from before.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20041223.png' alt'' />
