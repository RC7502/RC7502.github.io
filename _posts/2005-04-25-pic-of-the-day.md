This is the <a href=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0504/22/index.htm>coolest thing</a> I've seen in awhile. No, not the Superman picture scroll down to see the first image of the motorcycle to be used in the Ghost Rider movie currently in production. Ghost Rider is an old comic about a motorcyclist who is given the powers of a demon to bring the guilty to justice. The movie is based on the original Ghost Rider Johnny Blaze. In 1990 Marvel started a new Ghost Rider series and it was the first comic book I ever owned. I collected about a dozen different comics over the following 10 years, but Ghost Rider was always my favorite. The story is simple enough they shouldn't be able to mess it up too bad for the movie. As long as he has that motorcycle, a flaming skull and kicks a lot of ass I'll be happy.<br />

In other news I didn't get a comic done today because Goz talked me into trying this new program called Comic Life. After spending a couple of hours with it, it overwrote all of the work I had done so far and I didn't feel like starting all over. It seems like it could be a cool program if they work out some of the bugs.<br />
