Need a little pick me up with words of wisdom from The Simpsons? Do you have text messaging? Send the command:

<code>follow homerbot</code>

to 40404 and it will send you a quote at a random time in the morning and afternoon (Eastern Standard Time) Monday through Friday. If you do not want to receive anymore quotes, send:

<code>off</code><code> homerbot</code>

to 40404. If you already have a Twitter account, you can go to <a href="http://twitter.com/homerbot">http://twitter.com/homerbot</a> and follow him.
