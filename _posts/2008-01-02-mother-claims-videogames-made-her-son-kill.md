<blockquote> Lorraine Harling claims in the tabloid sleaze-rag News of the World article that she and her husband had no idea of the "well of savagery" that had built up in their son Stuart. "Stuart never gave us any reason to think he was violent at all," she said. "He was a very normal boy - quiet and reserved. I used to call him 'my little professor.'"Stuart Harling, 18, was convicted two weeks ago of the murder of nurse Cheryl Moss, who he stabbed 72 times while she was on a smoke break. According to the article, the attack took place "just like he'd PRACTICED on the PlayStation in his bedroom."</blockquote>
For starters, I don't know what videogame requires the user to stab a nurse 72 times on her smoke break, let alone how you're going to practice that with a playstation controller. I would think the Wii would be more like the real thing.

I'm sure the 18 year old was practicing a "stabbing" motion in his room, but with a very different outcome.
