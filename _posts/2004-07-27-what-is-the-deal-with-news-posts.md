Friday night Brad, Keaton, Keaton's boss and I went to the Palace theater to see Jerry Seinfeld. It was a really good show. At the very end he said that a Seinfeld dvd set would be out around November.

Yesterday, my PS2->USB adapter arrived in the mail. This one allows you to plug 2 PS2 controllers into one USB port. The Mac instantly recognized both dance mats and we were playing Stepmania in a matter of minutes. Even if we never played the same song twice we would have enough songs to play for years. We probably need to get a cheap machine dedicated to Stepmania so we don't have to use Brad's laptop all the time. Overall, this makes our daily DDR playing much more enjoyable.
