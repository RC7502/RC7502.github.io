Doom 3 was released this week and while I haven't played it yet I can't help wondering where my expectations should lie. A game or movie is only successful if it can meet expectations. If a game comes in under the radar and plays well it can become a sleeper hit. Whereas, if a game is hyped at E3 for 3 years in a row and makes one mistake, it "sucks hard".

So what are my expectations of Doom 3? Will it revolutionize gaming as it predecessors did? I doubt it. I look at it more like a remake of the original. When you go to the store and buy a classic compilation like Namco Museum or Midway Arcade Treasures you don't complain because this version of Dig Dug plays just like the original Dig Dug. Quite the opposite, you want this Dig Dug to play just like the one you remember playing back in the day. That's the hope I have for Doom 3. I want a game that takes me back to the first Doom that I played for so many hours on our family's first PC. Let someone else revolutionize gaming. I want my nostalgia.
