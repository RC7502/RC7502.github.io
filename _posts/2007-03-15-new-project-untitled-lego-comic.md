A few days ago I talked about playing around with Comic Life and maybe doing a comic strip with my Legos. Well I did some research and it seems like first I would need a light box to take high quality pictures. Goz showed me this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ourmedia.org/node/253481">tutorial online</a> and it seemed easy enough. After a trip to the store and about an hour I had this:

The guy in the tutorial said he used daylight light bulbs. I only found one set at Lowe's that said that. I set my digital camera to digital macro mode and took this pic:

The guy in the back looks a little blurry. I might try cutting notches in my box to clamp the lights closer. If that doesn't work I might pick up two more lights. It could be a setting on my camera, if anyone has suggestions I'd like to hear them. For the fun of it I put some 75 watt soft white bulbs in and took this pic:

<img id="image1058" alt="img_0169.jpg" src="http://bitsmack.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/img_0169.jpg" />

I like the daylight bulbs better. Next I loaded the picture into Seahorse (a free photo editor for Mac) and after spending an hour muddling through how to use alpha channels I was able to produce this:

<img id="image1059" alt="test1.jpg" src="http://bitsmack.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/test1.jpg" />

If I want to do backgrounds in Seahorse I might not need the baseplate.

So that is where I am at right now. I am kind of turned off on doing my comic in Flash just because they don't have an Intel Mac version out and the regular version crashes a lot on my new Imac. I have been kicking around some ideas with my three explorer dudes shown here. Stay tuned for new adventures!
