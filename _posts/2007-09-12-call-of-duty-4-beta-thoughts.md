I lost internet at my house 3 times last night while trying to download the Call of Duty 4 demo. Once I finally did get in, here was my experience:

1. XBOX Live in general, I wish there was an easy way to ask someone to invite you to THEIR game. If I know two of my friends are already in a game I don't have an easy way to tell them to invite me.

2. The first game I went into was free-for-all. This is nothing like an actual war and I think CoD is better when it's trying to be realistic. 

3. I liked seeing my XP go up after each round, though it didn't seem like I was put in a room with people of the same rank. But this could be an option I missed. When I am learning a new game I would rather play against other newbies then get instapwned (copyright Russ Collins).

4. Second game was a team deathmatch with 2 friends and 5 or 6 other people. The problem, our team had about 8 and the other had 2. The entire game was a race to see who out of my team could hunt down these 2 suckers first. There was more lag in this team match.

5. Went back to free-for-all, I do like that when you die it shows you your last few seconds of life from your killer's point of view. It kinda sorta shows you when you are doing something wrong.

6. Overall I think the graphics are a huge improvement (with the exception of the falling leaves that were too shiny and glowing and I kept mistaking them for a powerup or something). I would probably like the single player campaign better than the multiplayer. There is some intangible quality that makes some FPSs better on single player or multiplayer. CoD, Serious Sam and Doom I like playing single player, but Gears, Quake 3, Halo and Timesplitters I like playing multiplayer. I don't know why some games are better in one or the other. 

I don't know when Call of Duty 4 is supposed to be released but it's a good thing they gave us this beta to play with before Halo 3 comes out since that will probably be the FPS of choice for awhile.
