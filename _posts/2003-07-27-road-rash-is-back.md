I have great news. In the latest issue of EGM my brother learned that a new Road Rash game is being made. I'm not sure if it will be made for all three systems(Gamecube,Xbox,PS2) but it will probably be incredible. It's coming out next year. I bought my first Road Rash game on August 7,1993 and I've been a Road Rash fan eversince.

For those of you who don't know what Road Rash is, it's a motorcycle racing game. You race other bikers to earn money. You must qualify on each race. To qualify, you must finish each race in third place or better. The cops also chase you. If they catch you, you're busted. As you earn more money, you can buy better motorcycles.

Wild horses couldn't stop me from buying the new Road Rash when it's released. It will most likely be awesome. Don't pass it up.
