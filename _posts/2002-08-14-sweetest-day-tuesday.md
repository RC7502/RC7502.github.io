Yes, yes, I beat Warcraft III yesterday, now who wants to touch me. I said "WHO WANTS TO FREAKIN TOUCH ME!!" :-D
<br />

<br />
Greetings fellow BiTsMaCkErS I Kruton6 completed WC3 yesterday, a grueling endeavor as my elves blasted the evil undead into submission with a sweet cutscene as my reward.
<br />

<br />
Now a lot of people have asked me what am I going to play next and I wondered the same thing. So I picked up the PS2 controller and put in Gitaroo Man. Now when we last left the game we were on level 6 of 10 and I ended up completing that game too!!! 
<br />

<br />
So I guess I'm down to playing DDR and well, nothing just yet, but hang tight cause I have loads more video games to play :-)
<br />
Until next time
<br />
