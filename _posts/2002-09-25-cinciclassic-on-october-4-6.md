Bitsmack will be sponsoring a table at this year's <A HREF='http://www.cinciclassic.com/'>CinciClassic</a> which will be held at the <A HREF='http://www.forestfair.net/'>Forest Fair Mall</a> in Cincinnati, OH. 
<br />

<br />
I want to have a Kaboom! competition at our table, but RC and I haven't decided on a prize yet. Don't worry, I won't be in the competition (like anyone here can challenge me... :-). We will be demoing BattleSphere for the Atari Jaguar, and if we can get a Jaglink cable, we will be able to have head to head competitions!
<br />

<br />
If you need a diversion on Saturday, come on down. I haven't been to the <A HREF='http://www.forestfair.net/'>Forest Fair Mall</a> for awhile, but I do remember they have cheap movies and an arcade.
