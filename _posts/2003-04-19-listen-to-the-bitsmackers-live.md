Gozar and I will be broadcasting LIVE Saturday night at 8pm EST from his basement in the first ever Bitsmack shoutcast. You can chat with us during the broadcast by messaging AIM screenname "bitsmackers". You can listen to us LIVE by clicking <a href=http://av.bitsmack.com:8000/listen.pls>here.</a> 
<br />

You must have Winamp to listen to the broadcast. Right now the link won't do anything. The server won't be up until 8pm. If you have any questions on how to listen, click Comments.
