Basically, in order to pad out all the days in December with Christmas specials we decided to pick random Christmas episodes of shows we have on DVD. This time it is How I Met Your Mother, the Christmas episode from season 2. 

At this point in the series Lily and Marshall had gotten back together after being broken up for awhile. Lily goes all out on decorating the apartment for Christmas. She finds an answering machine that still had messages on it from when they were broken up. One of the messages was Ted where he told Marshall to get over Lily because she was a "grinch", but he didn't say grinch, he said something much worse. Lily responds by stealing Christmas.

Ted and Lily get in a fight and Ted decides to go have Christmas with his ultra-religious family. There's a B story with Barney being sick and Robin taking care of him that really goes no where. There's a better side story where Marshall tracks down his gift for Lily on a delivery truck and ends up helping the guy finish all his deliveries before Christmas. Marshall got Lily an Easy Bake Oven because Ted remembered Lily saying she wanted one way back when they were in college. The gang goes and rescues Ted from his family and teaches a couple of kids a terrible word. Merry Christmas! I give this episode a 3.5 out of 5.
