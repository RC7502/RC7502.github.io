Oh great another Christmas special based on a song. Although this one is stop motion animation so I already like it better than Frosty.

Apparently Claus was an orphan in Germany during World War II. The mayor Bergermeister (possible relation to Beermeister?) did what any normal German would do and have his lackey drag the baby through a blizzard to the orphan asylum (where all crazy babies are kept). The baby gets swept up in the storm and ends up at a small toy factory that continues making toys no one wants. I'm assuming they came up with the Furbie. 

Santa delivers some toys to a nearby town and this pisses off Herr Burgermeister. The mayor then declares war on <del>jews</del> toys. He chases Santa out of town. On a side note, for some reason Santa has a penguin friend. Where did that come from? Penguins are from the south pole not north. Anyway, after escaping persecution Santa runs into the woods and meets Gandolf the grey wizard. Santa gives Gandolf a toy and in return Gandolf teaches Santa how to invoke the dark arts. 

Santa uses his newfound magic to deliver toys to kids. He puts them in stockings hanging by the fireplace so they won't be found by the roving Nazi Toy Death Squads. The gang eventually do get caught and then break out using some flying reindeer or something. I wasn't really paying attention. He marries the one girl in town that likes toys and then they moved to the North Pole to escape execution.  

Overall it's a pretty good show. I like stop motion animation and this one still looks pretty amazing even today. I give this a 3 out of 5.
