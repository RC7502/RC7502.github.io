I am working on a major redesign to Bitsmack.com but I need some ideas/input on what to do with the site. I don't want to get rid of video games reviews, but since so many sites do it better now (i.e. Gamespot, 1up.com) I want to change mine so that it does something you can't find anywhere else. Some of the possible suggestions so far are:
<br />

<br />
- allow people to track their collections/wishlists of video games, dvds, heroclix, comics, etc. 
<br />
- a module where you can rate video game stores in your area
<br />
- a video game high score database
<br />

<br />
If you have any ideas for what you'd like Bitsmack to do, just post your ideas in the comments below this news article.
<br />
Thanks!
