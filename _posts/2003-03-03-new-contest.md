Completely ripping off an idea from one of my favorite webcomics <a href=http://www.smbccomics.com/index.html>SMBC,</a> I've decided to have people vote on their favorite Bitsmack comic to be featured on a T-Shirt! You can nominate your favorite comic by clicking "comments" below (just include the date of the comic). I'll take these nominations and put up a poll so everyone can vote on their favorite comic. I'm also lowering the price of the comic T-Shirt to only $13.99!

Start your nominations today!!
