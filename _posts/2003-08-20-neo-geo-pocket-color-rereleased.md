I'm at EBGames last night and what do I happen to see behind the counter? The Neo Geo Pocket Color! I bought one of these a couple of years ago as a collectors item, and to play Sonic Adventure. Now you can get the system and 6 games for $80. They also have a 4 pack of games for $40. The system itself is not as wide as the original GBA but it is a little thicker. The screen is really nice. The games included in both packages and some of the best for the system: Metal Slug, King of Fighters and Samurai Showdown 2 to name a few. If you are looking for some cheap portable gaming I recommend picking this up.
