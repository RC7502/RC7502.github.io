Flashback to Sun and Jin about to get it on. Sun is looking good. Apparently they've been trying to get pregnant for a year but haven't been able to.

On the island: Sun finds out she's  pregnant.
Off the island: Sun and Jin find out they can't have kids.

It's interesting that the pregnancy test Sun takes is made by Widmore Labs, setting up Charles Widmore who shows up later in the series. There's a point where Ana Lucia wants Charlie's gun and Charlie is like "the last time you had a gun you murdered someone" uh yeah SO DID YOU Charlie. When Sun's pregnancy test is positive she wants to know how accurate it is. Kate is like "well let's go talk to an expert." Jack looks at the test is says "yep you're pregnant." Apparently Jack is an expert in counting pink lines. 

The best part is at the end when Ben describes exactly what he would do to them if he were one of the Others. "It's a good thing I'm not one of them, where's the milk?"
