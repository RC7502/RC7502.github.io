There hasn't been a lot of news to post lately. We won't see a lot of notable game releases until probably Christmas time. In the meantime, I am spending my time with Final Fantasy Tactics on the PS1. I really enjoy this game. Since it is more of a strategy game than RPG you don't have to really concern yourself with the story. Instead you just focus on team based battles. It's a hard game, but if there is a part I can't get by I just play through a monster battle to level up my guys and go back to try again. If anyone has some good strategies on what jobs and abilities to use post it in the forums. What is YOUR best team?

I've also been watching a lot of anime downloaded off the internet. I am really enjoying Hellsing, probably because it doesn't have giant robots or school girls. Evangelion and Zone of the Enders are pretty good too.

Lastly, this is going to be your last week to preorder your tshirt. If you don't preorder you may never get one, ever. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030908.gif' alt'' />
