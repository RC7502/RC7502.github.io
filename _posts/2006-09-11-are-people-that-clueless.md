There is a blog post for Netscape titled <a href="http://www.sampletheweb.com/2006/08/21/netscape-is-looking-for-a-few-good-people/">Netscape is looking for a few good people</a>. In this post, the writer explains that Netscape is hiring some social bookmarkers, editors, programmers, etc. The pertinent information for applying for a position is in the final sentence:
<blockquote>If you are interested in what weâ€™re doing at the new Netscape and you think you have the skills, drop me an email at ck at newnetscape dot com with all your vitals, a resume, etc.</blockquote>
The fun starts in the comments. Apparently people cannot read or write for positions that would require some compentancy in the English language.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">I HAVE ALL THE SKILLS THAT YOUR ASKING FOR. I AM A B.S. GRAD FTOM ITT TECK PLUS HAVE MILITARY EXSPIRENCE. IF YOUR INTERESTED CALL ME AT (253)XXX-XXXX</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

(I edited out his phone number.) Well, Darren, first thing you should do is learn where the caps lock key is. Second, you might want to invest in a spell checker and grammar checker.

Example 2 (Paul):
<blockquote>iâ€™m not sure i know what a social bookmarker is. but, if it is someone who surfs the web to find articles someone else has written, iâ€™m not sure i have time to do that. however, if we are talking about writing original articles, i would love to try my hand. iâ€™m sure i can stir some controversy and inform at the same time. how would you go about submitting a article to netscape</blockquote>
Alesia, you have the opposite problem as our friend Darren above. There is a key on your keyboard named Shift. You can use it to capitilize words!

Example 3 (Ed):
<blockquote>I as well canâ€™t say Iâ€™m crazy about your new format. Iâ€™ve been using Netscape since about 1995. I bought my first version of Netscape, I think it was 2.1. Iâ€™d love to work for Netscape having been a long time loyal user of your browser. When I left AOL in 1994 and switched to my local phone company as my ISP I kept Netscape. I continued to stay with Netscape up through version 4.97. Due in part the involvement of AOL your attempts at upgrading newer version of the browser fail miserably thru versions 5 and 6 until you did something right with 7. The problem now is yourâ€™re trying to kiss the collective asses of IE users and making a browser geared towards them and not your loyal long time users. I have version 8 on my computers, but donâ€™t use it because it doesnâ€™t automatically connect with my Netscape email program in version 7.2.

It was bad enough you spun off Mozilla, probably another brainfart move by that flunky organization AOL, but now you change the format which for the most part fails. Let some of us oldsters in to guide the way to a new and improved Netscape.</blockquote>
Nice one Ed. The article you are commenting on didn't discuss any browsers....

Anyway, go check out the other comments!
