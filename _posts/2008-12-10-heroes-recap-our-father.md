Since I got some complaints about the length of my recap last week click below to read the entire thing Needless to say spoilers ahead!

<!--more-->

Previously on Heroes <a href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2008/12/04/heroes-recap-the-eclipse-parts-1-2/">this stuff happened.</a>

Hiro and Claire watch as Noah takes ownership of baby Claire. Hiro doesn't speak English, Claire doesn't speak Japanese. Can you guess what ensues next? Hilarity! We find out that Hiro's mom was a healer and that she is dying. They want to put the catalyst in Claire. Hiro and Claire share and enjoyable moment and I wish they had more adventures together.

Sylar tells Arthur he's not working for him anymore. He burns Elle's body thus ending Kristin Bell's guest stint (unless of course they bring her back to life using any one of a thousand methods they have to do so).

Mama Petrelli tells Peter he has to kill Arthur. "But there's good in him I can feel it, I can bring him back from the dark side" Peter says.

Tracy and Nathan talk Arthur into letting Nathan be in charge of Pinehurst. Um doesn't he have Senatoring to do? No wonder nothing gets done in Washington. Tracy has been kinda useless lately. I miss DL and Micah. Anyway, Tracy shows Nathan the army guys they plan on giving powers too. This is awesome, we've stopped ripping off X-Men and have moved on to ripping off Captain America!

Claire tracks down her mom and baby Claire. Then she gets to change her own diaper. WEIRDED OUT. I do have to say bravo for making Mrs. Bennett look 16 years younger. For a second I thought it was a different actress.

Sylar catches up with a woman who is a human lie detector. He kills her old school Sylar style. The woman cries "I can't believe I'm getting murdered on my birthday." Sylar, completely covered in blood asks her coworkers for some cake. AWESOME.

Nathan talks to one of the future Steve Rogerses (who I am told later was on The 4400) on why he signed up for this program. His buddies were killed in Iraq and he could have stopped them if he had a super serum and an indestructible shield.

Parkman, Speedster and Ando form a new version of the Mod Squad and track down the courier that has Mr. Issac's sketchbook. So wait, how did Speedster take both guys with her? Did she carry them or something? Can they go fast because they are close to her? Anyway, Parkman reads the courier's mind and Ando is like "Solid." The guy tries to outrun Speedster with his bike. FAIL.

Hiro watches as his mom says she wants to give the catalyst to him, but his dad says he's too irresponsible. Both young and old Hiro look sad and say "d'oh".

Noah comes home and knows old Claire isn't who she says she is. His mentally turns on his badass detanation sequence. Old Claire tells Noah about how he's going to love this baby and blah blah blah she disarms the Noah badass bomb that could have went off.

In a surprisingly touching scene, old Hiro is reunited with his mom. She heals his memory loss and gives him "the light" which is like some kind of refreshing orange sensation.

The Haitian tells Peter "killing your father is a hard thing to do, I mean I killed my brother last week, but I'm not a wuss." Peter's like "fine I'll do it, don't triple dog dare me."

Sylar, still being awesome and covered in blood, tries out his lie detecting power on a guy in an elevator. It's kinda like Daredevil but less Afflecky.

The Mod Squad gets the sketch book of the Exciting Final Issue of 9th Wonders. Hiro and Claire are still in the past. Arthur gets there somehow (is this present day Arthur (and if so how did he time travel?) or past Arthur (and if so how did he know to come there?) and takes Hiro's powers (including the catalyst/light/orange glow and throws Hiro off the building. But Hiro is caught on a pole. The Mod Squad decides they have to find another time traveler to go back and rescue Hiro. NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT PLAN.

Suresh says to Arthur "your reddish orange goo is ready". Arthur is like "I'll just put my hands near it and hope something happens." And it does. Arthur puts a cigar in his mouth and is like "I love it when a plan comes together."

Peter and The Haitian show up and The Haitian puts the guard to sleep like a hypnotist. They hold Arthur at gun point. Nathan and Tracy send Suresh in to inject the first soldier. Here's an idea, let's have the guy covered in scales inject a guy with an experimental drug. COMFORTING! Peter finally shoots at Arthur but Sylar shows up and stops it. Sylar uses his new ability to find out Arthur is not really his father. Then kills Arthur. Once the soldier finally finishes convulsing he picks up a bolted down chair and throws it into a wall. So I guess he has super strength, YAWN.

TO BE CONTINUED...
