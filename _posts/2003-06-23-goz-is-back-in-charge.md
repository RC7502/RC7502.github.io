Yes, be afraid, be very afraid. Goz is back in charge! With K-dogg and RC out of the picture, be prepared to be dazzled by my command of the English language and my <A HREF='modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=299'>artistic abilities</a>.

<P>On the videogame front, I just purchased Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for the PC last weekend. I started doing the missions, but I haven't completed the first one yet. I died, so I went online to get some cheat codes. Now all I do is get the chain gun and mow down anyone in my way. I usually put in the code to give everyone a weapon, that way they at least have a fighting chance. I haven't been able to get my wanted level above 4 stars though, I wonder who I have to kill to get to 5 or 6!<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030623.gif' alt'' />
