It's time for a Bitsmack "Choose your own adventure". It's 4am and you are awaken by a pounding at the front door, followed by indistinguishable yelling by a man and a woman. Do you:

a. Open the door to see what they want.
b. Call the cops.
c. Stay in bed and hope the whole thing blows over. 

If you chose C then you and I think alike. I found out by my neighbor this morning that the guy banging at the door had <a href=http://www.nbc4i.com/news/5160029/detail.html>got stabbed over by the railroad tracks</a> near my condo. I am pretty sure he doesn't live in my neighborhood. In retrospect I probably should have called the cops, but somebody had already done that and they arrived pretty quickly. 

And of course it gave me an idea for a comic...
