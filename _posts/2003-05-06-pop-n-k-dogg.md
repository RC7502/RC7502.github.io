Alas I have the mysterious DDRMAX2 for PS2 JPN and it's been a disappointment. The unlocks and extra are incredible but it lacks certain songs that were in the arcade version and were unique to the mix itself! I noticed that A Minute Extended Remix Version was not in the game the minute I started the game and it wasn't the first song on the list! Yesterday I realized It's Raining Men by Gerri Haliwell (ex-Spice Girl) wasn't in the game either!! The game adds old school songs that are way overplayed in the arcade such as Dead End, B4U, Drop Out, and Dynamite Rave with a couple from DDRMAX like Kind Lady. All in all it's an ok mix since it lets you unlock the Oni (Challenge Mode) songs for pay in the normal game mode. It also give the JPN players a chance to play the DDRMAX USA home version songs. It has one of the scoring courses from the arcade mix BUT changes the last song from A Minute to Spin the Disc. I could go on and on but I have more to talk about.
