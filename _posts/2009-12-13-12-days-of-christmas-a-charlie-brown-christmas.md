This is one of the all time classic Christmas specials. Seeing this now, Charlie Brown is one of the saddest characters ever. The other kids are downright mean to his face, it's great! Anyway, Charlie Brown walks around town complaining about the over commercialization of Christmas. Since he is universally hated by the town Lucy suggests he direct the Christmas play. Before he showed up their play was just going to be a bunch of kids dancing to the Peanuts theme like they're having seizures. Charlie and Linus go out to get a Christmas tree but all the ones available are made of metal and come in neon colors. They find one real tree that looks pathetic and take it home. Of course everyone hates the tree and Charlie wonders if anyone knows what Christmas is really about. Then Linus recounts the Christmas story from the Bible. They decorate their sad tree and sing. Short and sweet, I give it a 4.5 out of 5.
