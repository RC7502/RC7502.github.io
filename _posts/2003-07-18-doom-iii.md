I have great news for Doom fans. A Doom game is being made for the Xbox. It's called Doom III. I saw a picture of it in EGM and let me tell you, it looks awesome. I think it's going to be released sometime around January.
<br />
I've been a Doom fan since 1995. I thought the original Doom was awesome but this new doom blows it away. 
<br />
If you're a Doom fan like me and if you have an Xbox, you cannot pass up this Doom. It will probably be the best game made for the Xbox and maybe even the best video game ever made.
