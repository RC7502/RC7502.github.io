"The Western Super Mario Bros. 2 is actually a re-skinned version of the Japanese platformer Doki Doki Panic."

<strong>Earliest Memories </strong>
The first time I can remember playing SMB2 was at a friends house. I thought it was awesome that you could now play as the Princess or Toad and they each had special abilities. At the time I didn't know that SMB2 wasn't originally a Mario game, but it is pretty obvious now. All the bad guys are different and when you jump on them they don't die, you have to pick them up and throw them. Plus there was new stuff like beakers that make magic doors. 

<strong>Does this game belong in 1000 Great Video Games?</strong>
I think it's pretty amazing that Nintendo took some random game and called it Super Mario Bros. 2 and it turned out to be actually a good game. There have been plenty of times when a sequel of a great game has turned out terrible. This could have easily been a disaster but Nintendo pulled it off. I do believe this game deserves to be in 1000 Great Games.
