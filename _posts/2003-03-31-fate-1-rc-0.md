I didn't get a comic done today and here's why.
<br />

<br />
On Saturday my ReplayTV decided to stop working. After an unhelpful call to tech support I ended up having to take it back Sunday. Thankfully, it hadn't been 30 days yet so I could exchange it. The Best Buy staff was helpful and the exchange went smoothly. I then had to program in all the shows again which takes forever. I will have a new comic up tomorrow though.
