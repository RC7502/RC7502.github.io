We got some preorders for the NES shirt but it'd be nice to have about 5-6 more. Right now I'm not ordering any extra so only people who preordered will get one. The deadline for ordering is Sept. 30. If you haven't paid yet you can use the PayPal link or give the money to me or K-Dog directly. Thanks for all the support you guys have given the site over the last year.
