Come one, come all to yet another <b>Anime Night</b>, hosted by yours truly, this upcoming Friday the 11th of June! The fun starts at 6pm, and its going to be held at my new apartment here in Findlay! I'll have some snacks and sodas for everyone, but as before, its BYOB- Bring you're own <a href=http://www.bawls.com/>Bawls.</a> (^T^)<p>
<br />
Animes that are going to be shown are still up in the air, so if you have any ideas please be sure to post them in the forum. If you want to watch something specific but don't have it, please be sure to ask! Also, there will be DDR and Karaoke revolution for those interested.
