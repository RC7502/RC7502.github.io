When I originally read <a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/kotaku/full/~3/iaPQ-Petchc/scene-it-brings-twilights-sparkle-pony-vampires-to-the-wii">this article</a> I had to check my calendar to make sure today wasn't April 1st. Apparently Konami is bringing Scene It: Twilight to the Wii. 

<strong>WHY??</strong>

There is only one Twilight movie so far (the second one coming in November) so what are they going to show clips of? Here are a list of franchises that would have a better Scene It than Twilight:

Disney (countless films, cartoons and tv shows)
Marvel (26 films + cartoons)
Star Trek (11 films + 5 tv series)
Star Wars (6 films + cartoons)
Harry Potter (6 films so far)
Indiana Jones (4 films, 3 of them good)
Lord of the Rings (3 long films)

Some of those have already been made into the board game Scene It, but not a console version. I understand that Twilight is the hot thing of last year but they might as well call this game Scene It: Quarterly Revenue Boost. 

What do you guys think? Are you going to be camping out at Gamestop for a midnight release of Scene It: Twilight, or would you not touch that thing with a 10 foot cross?
