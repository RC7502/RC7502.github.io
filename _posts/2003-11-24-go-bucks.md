It's a shame that <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=359>OSU lost.</a> Even though I am an Ohio State fan, I have to say they pretty much sucked hard last Saturday. Oh well, back to the games.

I picked up Project Gotham 2 and it is awesome. If I am playing single player as soon as I finish a level I can instantly see how my score ranks with everyone else online. Right now my ranking sucks so I need to go play more.
