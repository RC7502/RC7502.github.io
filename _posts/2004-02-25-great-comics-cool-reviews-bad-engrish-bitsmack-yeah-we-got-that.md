I gotta give some props out to <A HREF="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2789020576&category=51097">these guys</a> really quick. BEST EBAY AUCTION EVAR!

Anyway, haven't been doing much lately other than school work. I got Pop N Music 9 last weekend and it's pretty tight that they utilize long version songs, new expert courses, some old songs and even a menu ordering system that I tried to play but since I can't read Japanese I selected a REALLY hard set of songs.  There's a neat new unlocking system called Gambler Z that looks like a little Final Fantasy type of board running around a dungeon opening treasure chests and collecting goodies.

Anyway, I'm busy :-p

K-dog out!!
