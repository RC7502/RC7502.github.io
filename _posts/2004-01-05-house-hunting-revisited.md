As you can tell by <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=373>this comic,</a> I've started looking for a house again. This month marks one year of me living in Columbus and my lease is running out. If I can find a better deal I'm outta here.

Also, if you don't get today's comic, pick up a copy of Paperboy right away.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040105.gif'   />
