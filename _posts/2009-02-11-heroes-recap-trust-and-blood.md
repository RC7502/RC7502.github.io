According to two different people this weeks Heroes really sucked. Let's see for myself!

<!--more-->

Previously on Heroes, scene after scene of people getting shot with stun guns!

The plane is going down! Cut to Nathan exactly 43 hours later. Apparently the budget wasn't big enough to show us a plane crash so Nathan telling someone about the crash over the phone.

Back at the wreckage, Stryker's strike force is hunting the X-Men. Parkman, Suresh and Hiro hide in the dumbest place ever and luckily outsmart the dumbest soldier guy ever. The writers finally realized that Hiro is too powerful so he doesn't have powers right now.

Noah catches up to Claire and she's all like "your shadowy conspiracy is over, people are going to ask about that plane crash". Then Noah is like "oh yeah?" and missles fall out of the sky destroying the rest of the wreckage. People aren't going to ask questions about that???

Nathan wants to capture the mutants but Stryker want's to kill them off. Hiro, Parkman and Suresh find a trailer and change of clothes. Parkman goes all milky eyed and starts drawing. This is a note for the makers of Heroes: I get it that the first season it was really cool to have a guy paint pictures of what was going to happen in the future. But Mr. Issac is dead now, can't that power die with him? We don't always need to know bad things are going to happen in the future. Why can't we just be surprised? Anyway, Sylar has been torturing the stryke force guy and not getting anywhere, so now he's going to torture the woman who lives there in front on the stryke force guy. That's awesome.

Peter and Tracy knock out some guys and Peter starts to put one of their uniforms on. Tracy is like "did you see that in an old movie?". My thoughts exactly. I like how on movies everyone's clothes fit everyone else. Noah is trying to send Claire back home but she's pissed because she gets to live a normal life while her friends get hunted. "What if they found out you are one of us Nathan?" she says. Uh, those two guys in the tent with you know now. Speedster swoops in and saves Claire. Noah and Nathan exchange words and Noah is like "what if Stryker found out you had powers?" Uh, those two guys are still there listening to all this.

Hiro, Ando, Parkman, Speedster and Claire converge on the tail of the plane. Speedster gets shot and then Parkman being totally badass mind controls the stryke force guy and forces him to shoot the other guys. Stryker himself shows up and recaptures Claire.

Sylar starts choking the lady to get the soldier guy to talk. There's something very cool about a guy torturing someone while drinking out of a flower mug. In turns out the lady's son has powers too so he'll probably be dead by the end of this commercial break.

Nathan and Stryker are in disagreement about killing the mutants again. Nathan gets a phone call from Tracy wanting her freedom. Nathan is like "you don't have anything that I want." And Tracy is like "I have peter." Then Nathan is all like "AWW crap I want that."

Sylar finds out that the new kid's abilities is a microwave ray he can shoot from his hand. That should come in handy when it's time for Hot Pockets. The soldier guy gets away and grabs his gun. Microwave boy kills him with his powers. It looks like Sylar has a new protege. Since we haven't seen this dude's dad I am going to assume that he and Sylar are brothers.

Nathan shows up for Tracy and Peter's trap, Tracy double crosses Peter then Nathan double crosses Tracy. She got what she deserved and Peter flew off with Nathan's power. Brad was right Peter can only hold on to the power of the last person he touched. So now Sylar is the only one overly super-powered.

Peter meets up with Suresh, Parkman, Ando and Hiro. They decided to form X-Force and lay low for awhile. Claire is back home. She gets texts about a rebellion THAT ARE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS. THIS PERSON HAS NO IDEA ABOUT TEXTING <span class="p">ETIQUETTE</span>.

Remember how Nathan was has been talking on the phone this whole episode. It turns out he has been talking to his mom the whole time and she wants nothing to do with him. ANTI-CLIMATIC!

Wait, the episode is over and we haven't seen Speedster anymore. Is she dead for sure??

Overall this episode wasn't as bad as everyone made it out to be. I am looking forward to more of the storyline of all the guys on the run and Sylar's storyline is getting interesting as well.
