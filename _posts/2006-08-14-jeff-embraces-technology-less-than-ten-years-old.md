Those that know me know that I am what marketers refer to as a "late adopter."  Though I am a highly-skilled information technology professional, and I like to consider myself an 00ber-geek, the truth is, "teh shiny" just doesn't have the same appeal to me anymore.

A few examples... the main TV in our house is a 9-inch Toshiba built circa 1983.  Connected to the TV is a device called "rabbit ears" from which the TV extracts over-the-air broadcasts.  Also connected to the TV is a Nintendo Entertainment System, a Sega Genesis, and a VHS videotape player.  I recently upgraded the main computer in our house to Windows 2000, because the Windows 98 installation was getting crapified and no amount of rebooting seemed to help.

So, my only point with this prattle is to help you understand the magnitude of what I am about to reveal.

It was <a href="http://bitsmack.com/wp/2004/02/02/lungfluke-enters-the-1990s/">two and a half years ago </a>that I entered the Nintendo handheld universe, with a cool purple Game Boy Color system.  And, as awesome as that system was (is!), it was just too annoying: dippy external light, bulkiness, and a patented scratch-attracting screen that Apple subsequently licensed for use on the iPod nano.

But, finally the stars aligned themselves over the weekend, and I am now a proud owner of a brand new Game Boy Advance SP (the new kind with the brighter screen).  This system is so cool that it defies words.  It's so small, the screen is so bright (and gets even brighter), and has built-in, long-lasting rechargable batteries.  It plays my old Game Boy and Game Boy Color games just fine.

It also, of course, plays Game Boy Advance games, and what's the point of getting a new game system without any games to go along with it?  So, I have added <em>The Simspons Road Rage</em> to my collection... a lame, uninspired game, good only for a few minutes' mindlessness.  But, the real gem is <em>Onimusha Tactics</em>, a medieval Japanese turn-based strategy/RPG game that has totally sucked me into its world.  It seems that all of the RPGs I've played over the years have all been Tolkein-esque affairs with elves, dwarfs and dragons.  I never thought I'd get into a game with Japanese characters since, you know, all Japanese people are exactly the same, but, it turns out I was wrong... I can tell the difference: Oboro is an airhead, Magoichi is a jerk, and Kabuki is cool.

A <a target="_blank" href="http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021021.gif">Bitsmack cartoon from a long time ago</a> now describes me perfectly.
