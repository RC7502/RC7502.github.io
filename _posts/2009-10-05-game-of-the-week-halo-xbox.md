This weeks game is the classic Halo. What a coincidence that last weeks game was the first Gamecube game I ever bought and this weeks is the first XBOX game I bought. Picture it, the fall of 2001 in Findlay, Ohio. I was a poor college student. I wanted a DVD player since all I had was a DVD drive in my computer and a video cable running from the bedroom to the living room TV. If I could make it through a whole movie without the computer locking up I was pretty lucky. Then I received a notice from my credit card company that my credit limit went up. Doing the responsible thing I started weighing the pros and cons of whether I should get a PS2 or the XBOX which was just about to be released. I wasn't a Playstation fan at all. The only PS1 games I played a lot were Final Fantasy 7 and Chrono Cross. The PS2 was already a year old so I went with the XBOX so I could have the newest thing. I hadn't really researched the launch titles so I just asked the guy at Gamestop what the best XBOX game was and luckily he said Halo and not Fusion Frenzy. It was a ripoff that I had to buy a DVD remote to watch movies but I did it. 

I enjoyed Halo and played through the whole thing. My only complaint was that the last several levels look very familiar. It'll be fun to get that game out again this week.
