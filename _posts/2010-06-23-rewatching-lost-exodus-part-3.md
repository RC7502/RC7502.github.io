So here we go, Season 1 finale. This one starts out with Locke being dragged through the jungle by the smoke monster. You get to clearly see the smoke monster in a couple scenes. Of course we now know the smoke monster can't directly kill the candidates so what was his plan here? 

On the island: The Others weren't coming for Claire's baby, they wanted Walt for some reason. 
Off the island: More scenes from the morning before the plane took off.

Even though we see the smoke monster it is making mechanical noises like a roller coaster going up a big hill. Hurley sees the numbers on the hatch and freaks out. What I don't get is why Dharma etched the numbers into the hatch in the first place. I also don't know why The Others wanted Walt. The episode ends with Jack and Locke literally looking down the rabbit hole. I was pissed when this aired the first time because we didn't see what was in the hatch. 

Ashley note: She wants to know why "the pirates" took Walt. She was also glad that this was the season finale and not the last episode, which she originally thought was the finale.
