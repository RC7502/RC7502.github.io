What a week!
<br />
I ended up going to see "School of Rock" with Tenacious D star Jack Black ("Orange County"). It was a humerous story about name fraud and raised quite a few questions about how his character pulled this stunt off. The music featured in the movie were oldies from the 80's and 90's (hard rock, and just general rock from the era). The movie itself was a definate family type movie with very little swearing and fun for the whole family.<BR><BR>

In other news, I pick up the <A HREF="http://www.dvdplanet.com/product_listing.asp?productid=35450&format=DVDsourceid=00398392438808830168">"Dual! Parrallel Trouble Adventure" DVD Box Set</A> since I had seen the series on <A HREF="http://www.techtv.com/animeunleashed/">Tech TV</A> once and thought it was REALLY COOL! It's from the makers of <A HREF="http://www.dvdplanet.com/product_listing.asp?productid=8264&format=DVDsourceid=00398392438808830168">Tenchi Muyo</A>.

I know I am!<BR><BR>

<br />
Next up, video games!
<br />
I purchased 3 GC games but I wasn't too happy when I found out they had sold Super Monkey Ball the day b4 I got there!! I ended up with Starfox Adventures, Worms Blast, and Pikmin. Not too shabby I think for about $35! Gamestop stores are currently running a buy 2 get 1 free deal at all their locations.<BR><BR>

Lastly, I was playing DDR at the arcade yesterday when my friend asks me if I want to play the Oni (challenge) steps to Dam Darriam and Love Love Shine! I was baffled because I knew there weren't any selectable Oni steps to those songs so he explains how the process works and I'm sold. So Eric and I work at getting the steps. WOW, those steps are SOOOOO cool! it makes both songs a LOT more enjoyable! If anyone has these unique steps from the arcade machine for one of the DDR simulators (SM, DWI) PLEASE send them my way!! Now that I've reminded you all I'm crazy!
