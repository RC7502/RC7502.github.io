Today's <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=382>comic</a> is in response to every review I read of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. Every review complained about how to play the game all 4 people need a GBA and link cable. Boo hoo! News flash, the GBA also <i>plays games.</i> It is not the "$99 Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles controller" that these reviewers would like you to think. Maybe I'm spoiled though. At the DevryGuyz place there are approximately 1.4 GBAs per person. Even Goz has a GBA and all he plays are classic games. His basement is like the Colonial Williamsburg of video gaming. But maybe I'm wrong, maybe not everyone has a GBA. So for that percentage of the population that is RPGery enough to want FFCC but doesn't own a GBA, you're screwed.

Oh, and the link cable is like $5 max.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040206.gif' alt'' />
