<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=335>Today's comic</a> is inspired by the new game Simpsons: Hit and Run. I've only played the game a little bit so far but it is easily the best Simpsons game yet (yes that is including The Simpsons arcade game). The only thing the game is lacking is the random violence. My theory on why GTA3 is so popular is that I know people who can play the game for hours and never do a single mission. They just drive off ramps, shoot people and steal cars. In the Simpsons you have to do missions to have any fun.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030926.gif' alt'' />
