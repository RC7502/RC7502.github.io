There's a poll over at <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/21/joystiq-poll-waiting-for-e3/">Joystiq asking participants what they're most excited about at E3</a>. Nintendo is at 73% in this very unscientific poll. When you look at the other contestants, you can see why.

Microsoft has already shown its cards in the Xbox 360, and from the early rumors, the PS3 will probably be more of the same. The wildcard is Nintendo with its new control scheme. What will Nintendo show? Will their new controller "revolutionize" how games are played?
