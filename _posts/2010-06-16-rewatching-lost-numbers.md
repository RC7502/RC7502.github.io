This is a great episode. We get Hurley's back story and a huge piece of the island mythology.

On the island: Hurley goes after the French woman to find out the origin of the Numbers
Off the island: Hurley wins the lottery using the Numbers and only bad things happen to everyone around him. 

The French woman had some numbers written down over and over. We find out in flashbacks he used the same numbers to win the lottery. In the last season we find out that the numbers correspond to Jacob's candidates. Why the French woman set up a repeating message of them, who knows. We find out Hurley owns a box company, the same box company Locke works at. I think it's great that even though terrible things happen to everyone around Hugo, he keeps making more and more money. He got the numbers from a mental patient who got them from another guy in the Navy when they heard the transmission. Apparently when the French woman landed on the island they heard the transmission too, but they all got "the sickness". So she changed the recording.  Also at the end we see that the Numbers are on the Hatch. Even though in season 5 they showed a guy hammering in the numbers when they were building the Hatch I still have no idea why.

Ashley's note: Hurley is sweet, and Locke is really nice for making Claire a cradle.
