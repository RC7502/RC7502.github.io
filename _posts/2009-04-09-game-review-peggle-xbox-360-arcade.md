Sure, I could spend the time to learn every possible command to lead a tactical strike team, but then it might as well be a second job. I like games that are easy to pick up and play but also have some lasting value. That is why I am really digging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQPDOM?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001EQPDOM">Peggle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001EQPDOM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

Peggle is laid out like a pachinko machine with lots of pegs everywhere. Most of the pegs are blue, some are orange. You have to aim and fire balls from the top of the screen so that they bounce around and hit as many pegs as possible. The board is clear when all the orange pegs are hit. There are also pink pegs that give score multipliers and green pegs that give different power ups. The great thing about this game is that you never know when you're going to get a lucky bounce and take out a whole bunch of pegs at once. Once the main adventure is completed a challenge mode opens up with even more difficult levels to try. 

Peggle is a great game when you have just a few minutes to play. It's also easy enough that non-gamers can enjoy. There are versions for XBOX 360, PC. If you have an XBOX pick up the trial version and check it out. I give it an A+.
