As kruton said yesterday, this has been a pretty slow week. The only video game I've been playing this week is DDR, at home and the arcade.

After my rant on Wednesday about the new Transformers shows I decided to watch the original series on DVD. I think the show still holds up after all this time. Even if I didn't watch it as a kid I still think it is better than most cartoons on the air now. That's not to say all new cartoons suck, I do like X-Men Evolution and Batman the Animated Series.

In case you're wondering why there are duplicate games in the "What's New" section, its because the same game was released for multiple systems. I'd also like to thank everyone who has been posting reviews. We now have over 300!
