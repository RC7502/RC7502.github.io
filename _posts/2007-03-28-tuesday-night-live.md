Last night we had the first ever Tuesday Night LIVE. Basically it is just a bunch of people getting on XBOX LIVE and playing games together. This week we played Gears of War. Chill, Kruton7, Daddykin, Deniolan and The Berb (although he has a new username and I don't remember what it is) were all in attendance. Playing 2 on 3 Gears wasn't the most fair, although Kruton7 and The Berb were probably the best two man team. Kruton7 and chill were probably the worst two man team.

If you would like to get in on some of the hot Tuesday night 360 action send your gamertag to bitsmack AT gmail.com. Also if you send me a friend request, put something in the message to indicate that I might know you. I usually turn down random friend requests unless I know the person.
