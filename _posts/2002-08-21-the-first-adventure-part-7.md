<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=42>Today's comic</a> is my most ambitious effort yet. I knew I couldn't do a cool fight scene in 4 panels so I went to a comic book style layout. 
<br />
<br />
Supposedly Chono Trigger is the greatest RPG of all time so I decided to give it a try via Final Fantasy Chronicles for PS1. I have to admit the game is pretty cool so far. Personally I still like Chrono Cross better, but I'm going to continue playing Chrono Trigger. Other than that there really isn't much going on this week. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020821.gif'   />
