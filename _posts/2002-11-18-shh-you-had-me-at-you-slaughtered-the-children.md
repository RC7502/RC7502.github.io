Ok, so a group of us were watching Episode II on DVD last weekend and we couldn't help notice that Amidala falls in love with Anakin, a total psycho. You might be wondering why I didn't notice this the first time I saw the movie. The first time I was so mesmerized that I left the theater spouting "Yoda... with the lightsaber... and the jumping... how?

cool."

Anyway, there was another DDR tournament in Findlay Saturday. This time there was a much better turnout. Kruton got second. I didn't compete. However, I did get pictures and they have been posted in the Photo Gallery.

Well, I'm going back to my game of Vice City. Then tomorrow, the highly anticipated Metroid Prime is released.
