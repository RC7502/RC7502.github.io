Here is my review for He's Just Not That Into You:

eh, I'm just not that into it

REVIEW ACCOMPLISHED.

Seriously, though it wasn't a bad movie and better than most chick flicks I've seen.

Not That Into You starts out telling us that all women are crazy and that their circle of friends will only support and encourage their craziness. Ok movie, you have my attention. Go on. It jumps around to several different stories so it's like you're getting 4 chick flicks for the price of one. The all star cast really helps with Jennifer Anniston, Ben Affleck, Scarlett Johanson, Bradley Cooper, Justin Long and Drew Barrymore. (I'm sure I misspelled most of those but I'm too lazy to use IMDB right now). I liked the multiple story lines because it kept the movie going at a brisk pace.

Each of the women had their own delusions. One would constantly obsess over every guy despite the signals that he's not interested. One was convinced a married man would leave his wife for her. And one thinks that her boyfriend of 7 years will eventually propose even though he's always said he doesn't want to get married. The men aren't completely without fault as they have their own problems. One guy thinks his friend will eventually become his girlfriend even though she doesn't feel that way about him.

There were a lot of women in the theater when we went to see it. When Ben Affleck did anything romantic I think the female audience collectively orgasmed.

Overall if you have to go see a chick flick for some reason this is a good one to see. There are a lot of funny moments and if you've ever dated there's probably something you can relate to. I give it a 3 out of 4.

4 = own it
<strong>3 = rent it</strong>
2 = watch it on tv while doing other things
1 = watch it just to make fun of how terrible it is
0 = never watch under any circumstances no matter how curious you are
