Last night I saw The Matrix reloaded with the guys at work and found out that the mall crew were in the same theatre! The movie is incredible and I highly recommend it to everyone! Aside from that I guess RC is coming up to the new place and we're having a big old games party fri/sat.

I haven't really gotten any new games lately but Pop N Music 7th should be here by Saturday. That is all for now :)

K-dog out!!
