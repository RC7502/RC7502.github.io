Here's a <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=456>comic.</a> I've decided to start doing one comic a week on Monday's. I don't want to stop doing the comic completely but I also don't have a lot of time and its getting harder to come up with ideas. I don't know how professional cartoonists do it every day. Not having a real job probably helps. <br />

In other news the podcast is getting a pretty good rank on podcast alley. We've almost broke the top 100!<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20050411.png' alt'' />
