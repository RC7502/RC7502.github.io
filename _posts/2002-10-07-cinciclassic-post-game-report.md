CinciClassic was a lot of fun. The exhibitors had a lot of cool stuff and the tournaments were fun. I thought I got some pretty good deals on some stuff. I ended up getting a Sega Master System and some games, a TG-16 and a couple games, a Sega Saturn and a couple games, and an NES Power Glove. The Power Glove was totally an impulse buy, just because it looks cool. I'm sure kruton and Goz will post to let you know the stuff they bought.

Kruton and I did pretty well in the tournaments. I got either 3rd or 4th in the Baku Baku tournement despite the fact I've never played the game before. I definately have to get this game for the Saturn. I won a Legend of Zelda water bottle. I also got 3rd in the DDR tournament and won an arcade stick for the Genesis. At our own table we had a Kaboom high score tournament. The grand prize winner was Chuck Amicone with a score of 36736! I'll post a picture of the winning score soon because this is quite a feat.

Kruton and I also met a guy named Dan that had I think every Japanese rhythm game for the PS2. There were drums and guitars and Para-Para Paradise. I'm sure kruton will post more about this, I just have to say Drummania is awesome.

I'll have more about CinciClassic and pictures up later this week.
