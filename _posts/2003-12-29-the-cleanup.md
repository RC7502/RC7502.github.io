<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=371>Today's comic</a> is true except for one part. K-Dog and I never help cleanup after Christmas.

Well I got some cool stuff for Christmas. 24 Season 2 DVD, Friends Season 5 and Coupling Season 2 (the good Coupling, not the American version). I also got a couple of hand-me-downs. Since my mom got a new microwave I got their old one. The microwave I had previous was so old it wasn't even digital. I think it was the brand "Radiation King". I also got Goz's old entertainment center. This is great because now I can finally have all my classic systems hooked up at the same time. I'll put up some pictures of my new gaming layout later. So I'm just curious, did anyone else get cool presents?<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031229.gif' alt'' />
