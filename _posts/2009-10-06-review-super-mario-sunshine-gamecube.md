I enjoyed the episodes 1-3 of Star Wars. I liked all the X-Men movies (I'm even lightening up on X-Men Origins: Wolverine). So, I don't go after things I dislike as vehemently as other people. 

That being said, <strong>I hate Super Mario Sunshine.</strong>

Nintendo had a great game, Super Mario 64, so it's not like they had to start from scratch with this, and yet they screwed it up so much. Super Mario Sunshine tells the story of Mario going on a much needed vacation to an island resort inhabited by puffalumps. As soon as he gets there they treat him like an illegal immigrant, give him a water hose, and tell him to clean up crap all over the island. <strong>Worst vacation ever.</strong>  

It follows the same format as SM64, you have to complete tasks to earn Shines (the stupid equivalent of stars) and then use Shines to unlock new levels. Most of the tasks involve spraying something with water or defeating some kind of boss. Where it really starts sucking is the camera and the controls. Here is a move by move recap of a level where I just have to jump from platform to platform (you know, the core gameplay of the entire Mario series):

1. rotate camera around until I have a good view of the ledge I'm jumping to
2. start my running jump
3. once I'm midair, camera starts rotating wildly out of control 
4. I realize I'm going to miss the ledge so I engage the water pack shooting down to allow me to hover an extra couple seconds
5. camera continues rotating wildly
6a. I barely hit the ledge and pull myself OR
6b. I fall back to the beginning of the level, curse Nintendo, throw the controller down and start playing something else

You could argue that maybe I just suck at these types of games. It's a valid yet insulting argument. However, I've obtained 120 stars in both Super Mario 64 AND Super Mario Galaxy. So how could I complete all the levels in those 2 games and yet not even completed the main story in Super Mario Sunshine? The answer is because it is a very sucky game. I can only recommend this game if you collect Mario games and you want this game to sit on your shelf. I can't recommend actually playing it at all.
