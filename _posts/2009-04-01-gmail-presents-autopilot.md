<a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/autopilot/index.html">From the website</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>The easiest email could possibly be.<br /><br />As more and more everyday communication takes place over email, lots of people have complained about how hard it is to read and respond to every message. This is because they actually read and respond to all their messages.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />With Gmail autopilot no longer do you have to worry about actually creating a response. Using technology from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/landing/cadie/">CADIE</a> project, Google will craft automated responses in your style. You can adjust for capitalization, typos, brevity and emoticon use.<br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=bc44bcc4-fdd5-8f18-ac50-e4f6bd18233e" /></div>
