Charlie's got the shakes because he's going through withdrawal. 

On the island: Jack gets stuck in a cave in, while Locke helps Charlie get over drugs.
Off the island: Charlie's band makes it big and he gets sucked into the rock and roll lifestyle.

We meet Scott and Steve, getting our survivors with names up to 17. 

Q10. Who knocked out Sayid when he was trying to locate where the signal was coming from?

Ashley's note: she's not too interested in Charlie but she was happy his brother got off drugs eventually.
