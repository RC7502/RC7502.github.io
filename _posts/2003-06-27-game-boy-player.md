I like the Game Boy Advance but it irritated me to have to play it on such a small screen. Now that's not a problem anymore. 
<br />
Nintendo has come out with a device called the Game Boy Player. It costs about fifty bucks. It connects to the bottom of the Game Cube and lets you play Game Boy games through your Game Cube.
<br />
It plays most Game Boy games and Game Boy Advance games as well. It's much more fun to play Doom and Doom II on my 19 inch television.
<br />
If you are tired of playing games on the Game boy's small screen and if you own a Game Cube, get the Game Boy Player. It's a must have.
