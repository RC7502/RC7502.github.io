In case you haven't noticed, the 80s are back in style. Just go to any mall and you'll see t-shirts galore of Transformers, GI Joe and Super Mario Bros. For those of us that grew up in the 80s, this is a great time. The other day I stumbled across a website <a href=http://www.x-entertainment.com/>(www.x-entertainment.com) that had articles on obscure 80s pop culture. <a href=http://www.x-entertainment.com/><img border=0 align=left src=images/news/20030821.jpg hspace=5 vspace=5/>Remember Bill and Ted's Excellent Cereal? How about a watch that turns into a robot? This site has all kinds of stuff that you haven't even realized you forgot. One of my favorite articles is a Toys R Us catalog from 1986. I used to love my Teddy Ruxpin until <a href=http://www.ryancollins.org/pictures/1986-RyanTeddy.jpg>Goz or one of his friends broke it.</a> So if you want to take a trip down memory lane check out this site. You'll wonder why you ever stopped growing your hair long and flipping your collar up.
