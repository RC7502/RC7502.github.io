I found a new web comic that literally had me laughing out loud. Check it out at <a href=http://www.meninhats.com/>www.meninhats.com</a>

Oh my god, another DVD set to buy, you bastards! It seems <a href=http://shopping.yahoo.com/shop?d=v&id=1808419742&clink=dmvi-upcoming&ft=DVD>South Park</a> will become the next TV show to release season DVD sets. Even though I haven't watched the show for years, I did enjoy the first season. Of course, with Star Wars Episode II, Spider-Man, and the Back to the Future trilogy coming out at the same time, I doubt I will pick this up.
