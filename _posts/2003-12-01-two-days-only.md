If you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=361>problem.</a>
<br />

<br />
It's offically the holiday season and while I look forward to Christmas itself, the "retail madness" I can do without. December means it is no fun to just go to the mall. I can no longer browse my favorite stores without fighting through crowds that resemble the infected people in 28 Days Later. Unfortunately, its just going to get worse every year. While Thanksgiving used to be able to hold back the cancer that is "retail madness", I'm afraid Pre-Thanksgiving sales have started popping up. At this rate, we may have to look to Halloween as our last line of defense.

Anyway, I did get a chance to try out the PS2 EyeToy at Best Buy. It was actually fun, and wasn't as gimicky as I thought it would be.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20031201.gif' alt'' />
