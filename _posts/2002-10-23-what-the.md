Uh yeah, I forgot to post today. Here is a <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=69>comic.</a> My 3D controller for the Saturn came today. I tried playing Nights but have yet to figure out that game. 
<br />
<br />
I have decided as of today I am not buying any more games or gaming accessories for the rest of 2002. Except for DDRMAX, I have to get that game, but after that.. nothing. I am also putting up some of the games I never play on ebay in a new feature I like to call: "RC's Ebay Item of the Week." The first item is going up later tonight. Stay Tuned for further details.
<br />

Ok I've got my first game up on ebay. You can see it in the "item of the week" section on the left side.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021023.gif'   />
