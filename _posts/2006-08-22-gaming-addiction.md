An i<a href="http://gameshogun.ws/index.php/Snow/2006/08/21/gaming_addiction_a_parent_and_the_gamers">nteresting article</a> at <a href="http://gameshogun.ws/index.php/">gameshogun.ws</a> tackles the views of parents and gaming addiction:
<blockquote><em>"Better Games than drugs. Who would disagree with this reasoning esecially when cited by teenagers hooked on computer games? This is the reason why computer game afionados should not be restricted in pursuing their hobby, said Gladys, a self-confessed computer game addict"</em></blockquote>
I've heard stories of high schools students whose only dreams in life are to get a minimum wage job so they have time to play videogames all day! Is this our Bitsmack readers feel?

At this stage in my life, I'm glad I went on to college, because now I can afford the geek toys. It's also taken me several years to get to this point. Do other just not have the patience to wait? I guess this is reflected in my buying habits. I'll rarely buy a new game when it comes out, prefering to wait until it drops to $20. Obviously I'm in the minority, which will be proven with the mad rush to buy Madden 07 next week (I saw Madden '06 already priced used at under $10!).
