It opens on Jin's eye. We get a flashback of him asking Sun's father for permission to marry her. Back on the island Jin goes ballistic when Sun walks around in a bikini looking hot.

On the island: Everyone thinks Jin burnt down the raft because he's such a bad guy.
Off the island: Jin is actually a good guy, he just got caught up in the bad things Sun's dad made him do. 

There's a cool moment in the flashback where you can see Hurley on TV. I just realized we haven't gotten his back story yet. Sun reveals to everyone that she can speak English, and we find out Walt burnt down the raft. 

Ashley's note: she's glad that everyone knows Sun can speak English because that story was dragging.
