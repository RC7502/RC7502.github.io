Last night was I think the first Thursday we have missed a podcast since we started back in like March. I completely forgot until about 9pm, and Goz was still working that late. As for K-Dog, he forgets every week anyway. I hope we can get something recorded this weekend. In the meantime:

Ultimate Spider-Man  = Good
Indigo Prophacy = Great
Serious Sam 2 = Seriously Sucky
