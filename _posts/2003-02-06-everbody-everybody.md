So, I'm at <A HREF=http://www.findlay.edu">work</a> yesterday and I'm thinking to myself, "Man, I gotta get that test done after work! No distractions tonight, No one's coming over to play games tonight! Not one single person!!", then I get an <A HREF="http://www.aim.com">IM</a> from <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/nwofreestyle/mainpage.html">Kwik</a> and he wants to know what I'm doing tonight. So I say not much and he says I'll be there in an hour....
<br />
Well, it didn't last long but I got my test done and had class and even met with my group for another class and everything worked out well. Then <A HREF="http://www.bitsmack.com">RC</a> messages me and tells me there is a <a HREF="http://www.homestarrunner.com">Homestar Runner</a> <A HREF="http://www.radiou.com">Interview</a> :-O
<br />
So I jet over there to hear all 11mins and 50secs of it and it is hilarious!! Someday I wanna meet these guys in addition to making our own <A HREF="http://www.macromedia.com">Flash</a> cartoons for the <A HREF="http://www.bitsmack.com">site</a>. 
<br />

<br />
The whole night was blah, blah, Keaton come fix my computer, blah, blah while <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/nwofreestyle/mainpage.html">Kwik</a> was here and we did get some <A HREF="http://www.iidxstyle.com">IIDX</a> time in but it was just another, "Let's all go visit Keaton night!" I did get to talk to <A HREF="http://fullofstarz.livejournal.com">Eryn</a> who told me some interesting stuff that I won't mention because I'm not 21 and therefore cannot attend the event :( and she also mentioned that Bill and Brittany were in Toledo today. I'm sure I also talked to <a href="http://groovemaster.livejournal.com">Groovemaster</a> and <A HREF="http://www.ryancollins.org">Goz</a> who had just gotten back from <A HREF="http://www.osn.state.oh.us/stateconf/">Ohio Schoolnet</a> which I didn't get to goto this year :'(
