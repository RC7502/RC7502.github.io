Between moving into my new place and going to Minnesota on business last week, my life has been utter chaos. I did get my computer hooked up last night but it still keeps rebooting randomly. I need to reinstall XP before I can get a comic done.

In other news, K-Dog, Brad, Rogg and I went to an arcade auction last Saturday. Rogg bought Ninja Gaiden and I bought Raiden. Eventually mine will become a MAME cabinet but for now I can enjoy some vertical shooting goodness. If you could own only ONE arcade game what would it be?

And finally there have been rumors about bringing back Bitsmack LIVE. I'm all for it if we can get some techincal issues worked out. We'll keep you informed if anything develops.
