Today mentionable game: <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=281185">Technic Beat</a><br />
Unfortunately I have yet to play the game but my roomate picked it up at the local Gamestop about 5 seconds ago and sent me an SMS about getting it for me :) .  Technic Beat is of course a rhythm game that features a song list of 86 songs for recognized artists such as Ryu and Sampling Masters known for their work in the Konami Bemani game series DDR and BM IIDX.<br />
<br />
According to Gamestop.com:<br />
In Technic Beat, players listen to music represented in the game by radiating concentric rings of sound. Picking up the beat, they dance into the middle of the rings and try to “catch” the music. If successful, they achieve the power to manipulate the sound rings and create entirely new music. As players progress and gain skill they are rewarded with spectacular visual displays, bonuses, and power ups.<br />
<br />
If that's not enough to make the room spin maybe you should try ectasy.<br />
(NOTE: IN NO WAY DOES K-DOG ENDORSE THE USE OF DRUGS)<br />

Tuesday: Two exams and then I'm done with the semester and on to my last round of skooling. :D<br />
<br />
It's good to almost be done :)
