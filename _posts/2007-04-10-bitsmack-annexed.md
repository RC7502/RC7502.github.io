I thought maybe I was getting bored with Gears of War on Tuesday Night Live. Then the new Annex multiplayer mode came out! Basically you have to occupy an area to earn points and whichever team hits 240 points first wins. Each game is the first team to win 3 rounds. The first game was Kruton7 and chill vs. The Berb and Emmit Fitzhume. After going back and forth on rounds chill and Kruton7 won 3-2. The next game had The Berb and chill vs. Kruton7 and Emmit Fitzhume. Kruton7's team broke out to an early lead of 2-0. Then chill and The Berb rallied together and scored 2 points of their own. In the end though Kruton7's team got the final point to win 3-2. Want to get in on the Tuesday Night LIVE action? Check out:
