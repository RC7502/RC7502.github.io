If you <a href="http://www.shootfortheedit.com/forum/showthread.php?s=3a9b34a28f525373ccd69cd67c7f0945&amp;p=5874#post5874" title="The Official Michael Bay Forums">listen to Michael Bay</a>, Microsoft is pushing HD DVD so that both HD DVD and BluRay will both fail and everyone will be downloading movies from Xbox live. 

If you want to play conspiracy theorist, Microsoft doesn't want a stalemate as much as it wants the PS3 to fail. If people are choosing between an HD Player and BluRay they may chose the PS3, and Microsoft doesn't want that! And now that the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/04/xbox-360-hd-dvd-player-stoops-to-129/" title="Xbox 360 HD DVD player stoops to $129 - Engadget">HD DVD attachment is $129</a>, it makes the Xbox 360 more attractive for high def viewing.
