The other night I decided to get out <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=338>Resident Evil</a> for the PS1. This is the first Playstation game I ever bought. While some say this game played a big part in created the "survival horror" genre, it also made huge strides in the "crappy voice acting" genre. Seriously, the cutscenes sound like something out of a high school play. So why would I get out an old game just to bad mouth it? Ever since I quit Gamefly I decided I would go back and play every game I have. I made a spreadsheet of all my games (so far just the newer systems, but I'll get to "Battletoads and Double Dragon" eventually), along with how far I am in each game and whether or not I want to keep it. Unfortunately I don't think Resident Evil is going to make the cut.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031001.gif'   />
