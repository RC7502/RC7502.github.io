Have a <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=306>rotten day!</a>

After playing Wario World for the GC I now realize Wario is not just an "evil Mario." Wario is like the "cool Mario." Where Mario jumps on his enemies and uses a wussy water pack, Wario punches, throws, and piledrives his enemies. Don't get me wrong, I still think Waluigi is <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Downloads&file=index&req=getit&lid=6>pure evil,</a> but nonetheless Wario World is a cool game.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030714.gif' alt'' />
