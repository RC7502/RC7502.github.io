<a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/dl/BSPC-051121.mp3">Tonight I ran out to Wal-mart to interview the 6 people who got in line to get an XBox 360 at launch.</a>

I've got to hand it to these people... Staying overnight at Wal-mart has got to suck.

There were plenty of games to be bought for them, including Project Gotham Racing 3. I'm a little curious of Perfect Dark 0, but I haven't seen any reviews of it yet.</td></tr></table>
