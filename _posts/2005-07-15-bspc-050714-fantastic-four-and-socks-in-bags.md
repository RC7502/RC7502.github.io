<p>==Intro==<br />
Goz: This is the <a href='/dl/BSPC-050714.mp3'>Bitsmack podcast for July 14, 2005</a><br />
<b>Intro Music</b><br />
<p>==Opening Banter==<br />
AND WE'RE BACK!<br />
Gozar: iRiver died.<br />
<a href='http://www.familyguyfiles.com/episodes/index.php'>Is there a joke you don't get in Family Guy?</a><br />
Gozar: Should we go to a higher quality mp3? Maybe in stereo? Currently we have a 24Kbps mp3 in mono. A half hour show is around 6 megs. If we go to stereo, that will increase the sound file to ~10 megs, but it should sound better. We could also try aac for iTunes/iPod listeners, which is higher quality. What does everyone think?<br />
<br />
Along the same lines, do we want the show to be longer? <a href='http://www.twit.tv'>tWiT</a> is an hour show, but they kinda meander through nothingless for at least 20 minutes of the show. :-)<br />

<a href='http://www.fantasticfourmovie.com/flash_index.html'>Fantastic Four</a><br />
* <b>Casting</b>: excellent (except for Susan Storm)<br />
* <b>Effects</b>: Mr. Fantastic was pretty fake. The Thing was good (although they were inconsistant with his weight). I liked the muscles effect when he's saving the firetruck. Torch's effect was very good!<br />
* <b>Weakness</b>: Final fight suffers from the first X-Men movie fate, it appears they ran out  of money so they had to have too short of fight. Susan Storm getting naked in public was weak.<br />
