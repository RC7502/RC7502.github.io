Sony recently released a new handheld video game system called the PSPGo. It's like the PSP but instead of a UMD drive it has a hard drive for downloading games. There have been reports of <a href="http://kotaku.com/5365557/another-retailer-says-nothankyou-to-the-pspgo">some stores refusing to sell the PSPGo</a> and I think they're absolutely right to do so.

But RC, why wouldn't a video game store want to sell the new system? Video game stores make very very little if anything on selling consoles. They make up that loss by selling accessories and games. But the PSPGo can only play games that are downloaded. If a store sold a PSPGo, that customer couldn't buy any games and wouldn't be back to buy games. There's also no used market at all for downloaded games which is where Gamestop makes all their money. To think up an analogy, selling the PSPGo would be like <strong>a hair salon selling a machine that cuts hair.</strong> They'd lose all their business. Or it would be like selling someone a gun so they could shoot you in the face. Well maybe that analogy doesn't work. 

I think the PSPGo is a bad idea in general. It's way more expensive than a regular PSP and also way more limited in features. However, I do fully support downloadable games. I think in the future we will hit the point where all games are downloaded. But I can understand video game stores not wanting to speed up their own obsolescence.
