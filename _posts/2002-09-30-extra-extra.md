Yes, Squidfest ROCKED totally and as the <a HREF="http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=today">
<br />
comic</a> suggests Battlefield was a big hit and requires a LOT of RAM and a very good graphics card.
<br />
So the theme for this week is probably going to be about the party.
<br />
BTW: The orgainizers are going to be making this a monthly event is anyone wants in for next time or is dissapointed they missed out.
<br />
<br />
Next up is my rant about <a HREF="http://www.cinciclassic.com">Cinciclassic</a>. I can't wait to go!! I'm just sooo excited that this place is in a bigger city and we're going to a mall that has a DDRMAX 2 machine!!! If you're involved at all or interseted in how the player choice tournament went DDRMAX won!!! WOOHOO!!!
<br />
<br />
Finally, the DDR 5th Mix machine at the Findlay mall is down for repairs because the amp went out in it and is being sent back to get fixed. If you had played on it last week you'd notice that the left speakers don't work. I think I'll manage for the week :-/
<br />
<br />
Well that's all for today,
<br />
K-dog out!!<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020930.gif' alt'' />
