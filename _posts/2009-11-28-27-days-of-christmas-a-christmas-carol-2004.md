Every day until Christmas Ashley and I are going to watch a different Christmas movie or TV special. Today it is A Christmas Carol, the musical version from 2004 starring Kelsey Grammer.

There are approximately 1 gillion versions of A Christmas Carol not counting the fact that every show that has ever been on television has done an episode version of the story. For the purposes of this review I'll highlight any differences or anything I think is cool. 

<iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=bitsmack-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&m=amazon&f=ifr&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&asins=B000ARTMWK" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" align="left"></iframe>The biggest difference in this one is the fact that most of the dialogue is sung. Also, I think it's a shame businessmen don't wear top hats anymore. When did the corporate world come to a consensus that they were all going to start being less awesome? When Jacob Marley shows up (played by Jason Alexander) there's this extended song where all kinds of ghosts are literally coming out of the woodwork. It's like a cross between The Monster Mash and Dawn of the Dead. 

This version is much longer than most I've seen. It expands on Scrooge's past quite a bit. He had a few bad things happen to him as a kid, then things are going well, then Scrooge and Marley turn into dicks. You know he's gone off the deep end when he chooses work over tapping Jennifer Love Hewitt. The ghost of Christmas present is played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0552509/">the black guy from Law & Order</a> (no not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026364/">the one from Hang Time</a>, the other one). Instead of using the typical grim reaper as the ghost of Christmas future, they used an old woman dressed up as a Mumm-Ra. 

Overall this was one of the better versions of A Christmas Carol I've seen. Grammer plays an old curmudgeon very well.  As far as Christmas movies go I'll give this one 4 out of 5 jingle bells.
