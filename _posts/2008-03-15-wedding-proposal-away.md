<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080314/od_nm/engagement_dc">Honey, will you marry... Oh. Never mind... - Yahoo News</a>
<blockquote> Hajji, of Hackney, east London, had concealed a $12,000 engagement ring inside a helium balloon. The idea was that she would pop the balloon as he popped the question.</blockquote>
When he left the shop, a gust of wind blew the balloon away.

So we have a guy who was going to propose in a way that no one has done before. He spent $12,000 on a wedding ring... TWELVE THOUSAND FREAKIN' DOLLARS! But the wind (probably the same one with the trash in <em>American Beauty</em>) dashed his hopes of at least getting lucky that night.

What gets me is her reaction to the story:
<blockquote>"But I had to tell her the story -- she went absolutely mad. Now she is refusing to speak to me until I get her a new ring."</blockquote>
<p align="left">What?!? The guy was going to propose, he spent $12,000, and she's mad because she doesn't have some minerals on her finger?!? Having someone love you enough to spend the rest of their life with you, through sickness and health, isn't enough for you? Richer or poorer indeed. Lefkos, get out while you can. I hope the ring is returned to you and you take it back to the store, and never bring up the marriage proposal again.</p>
