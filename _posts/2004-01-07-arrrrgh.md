So last night I had my comic completely done. When I went to save my computer rebooted. You're probably asking "why didn't you save more often?" Well jerk, when my computer finished rebooting I couldn't even open the file I was working on. It sucked.

Anyway, Circuit City has a pretty good deal going on right now. Prince of Persia (XBOX, PS2) is on sale for $40 and you get Splinter Cell (XBOX, PS2) free instantly. I'm pretty hooked on Prince of Persia. Since you can turn back time it makes those tricky jumps more bearable.
