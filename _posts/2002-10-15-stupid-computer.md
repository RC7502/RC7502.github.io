Well I submitted a post last night and now it's not there. So you get just a bunch of stuff I don't feel like typing...
<br />

<br />
I won the DDR tourney as mentioned b4 by RC.
<br />
Next tourney is on Nov 9th in toledo with 2 DDRMAX 2 machines.
<br />
And that's about all I have to say
<br />

<br />
