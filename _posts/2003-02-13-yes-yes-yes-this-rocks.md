Well it doesn't look like I'm going to make it to cbus this weekend due to gas prices, the weather, and the scarcity of Daredevil tickets. The bright side of the matter is that the log awaited Zelda URA disc (aka Ocarana of Time Master Course) is coming out this SATURDAY! I, of course, have my copy of the Wind Waker reserved and will be getting this special one-of-a-kind Disc! 
<br />

<br />
Last weekend I picked up where I had left off in FF2 for SNES and let me just say that the old skool FF games are AWESOME! Also, if anyone is looking to sell a copy of FF1 for NES I need it to complete met set of FF games
<br />

<br />
Well that's all for now!
<br />
K-dogg out!!
