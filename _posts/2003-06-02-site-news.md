Last night I bought a new hard drive for my main computer and attempted to use the direct hard drive copy disk that came with it. The copy failed at 97%. So now I have to install Windows to the new drive and hopefully be able to pull the BBS info off the broken drive. <b>Updated:</b> I got my machine up and running and the BBS is back without losing any information!

In other news, awhile back I asked people to nominate their favorite comic to go on the Bitsmack T-Shirt. I decided the way I'd handle it is every month there will be a different comic featured on the T-Shirt. This month's comic is <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=94>Legolas Pro Skater.</a> I'll start a new post in the forums where people can nominate a comic for next month's shirt. I've added some more products to the <a href=http://www.cafepress.com/bitsmack>Bitsmack Store</a> and all the products are now priced at the minimum. So check it out and help promote the site!
