Last week I <a href="http:/http://bitsmack.com/comics/2008/11/24/review-sold-out-a-threevening-with-kevin-smith-part-1/">reviewed the first disc of the third Evening With Kevin Smith DVDs</a>. Over the holiday weekend I finally got to watch the second disc. It starts out awesomely with Kevin talking about working on Live Free or Die Hard. This story goes one awhile and is by far the best thing on the DVD set. Next up he talks about trying to surf for a TV pilot that never got picked up. That was a pretty good story. After that is over someone is stupid enough to ask Smith about his anal fissures. Of course Kevin is only too happy to oblige in disgusting detail. This story takes up the rest of the second disc. It's not as mind numbingly boring as the dog story on the first disc but it is completely unnecessary.

The bonus features include short answers to more movie related questions such as Dogma 2 and the Clerks live action TV show. These features are much more like the first Evening and I'm not sure why they weren't included in the regular movie.

I think my main complaint with the DVD is that too much of the content comes from Kevin Smith the regular guy and not Kevin Smith the filmmaker. The reason anyone is coming to see him speak or watching these DVDs is because Kevin Smith made some movies we enjoy. That's what we want to hear about. Overall if you need this DVD to complete your Kevin Smith collection then by all means buy it. You won't be disappointed. If you are only a passive Kevin Smith fan then this would be a good rental.
