I just had to make a comment on this article because it is so crazy:

<a href="http://hawtymcbloggy.com/2008/02/28/another-gamer-screwed-by-microsoft/">http://hawtymcbloggy.com/2008/02/28/another-gamer-screwed-by-microsoft/</a>

To summarize, a guy gets a bunch of signatures on his XBOX 360 then it breaks down. He sends it to Microsoft and it comes back with all the signatures wiped off. I mean this really sucks and I felt bad for the guy at first, but then I realized the illogical turn of events that caused this to happen. 

This XBOX had a lot of sentimental value to this person. Forget Microsoft, why would you send it out anywhere? An analogy would be if you have a photo album and the binder breaks. You send the album with the only copy of your family photos in to get fixed and it comes back without the photos. Who would do that?? Had it not been erased it could have been lost in the mail, damaged, etc. Let's say that he sent it back and it came back perfectly, given the failure rate of 360s who's to say it wouldn't break down in another year. How many times would you be willing to part with your "prized possession" to get it fixed?

So if he doesn't send it back to get fixed, how does he play 360 games? Oh I don't know, buy a new 360? He could have gotten the core version because he wouldn't need the hard drive and accessories. If it is too expensive and he can't afford to replace it, <strong>then why was he carting it around to all these conventions?</strong> There are any number of other items you can have people sign. 

In conclusion, why should I care about this at all? It's because the interblag is making him out to be the ultimate martyr, a victim of Microsoft's tyranny. In actuality this person is only a victim of his own foolishness.
