I apologize for my absence but I'm finally done with exams which means more games!! Winter break will be a time in my life where I can appriciate the best things in life like DDR and Gunbound, and all the other games I own but haven't played in awhile. Other than that.... DDR tourney on the 20th of Dec here in findlay.... and that's about all I have for announcements.
