Inspired by these posts (<a href="http://thelastboss.com/post.phtml?pk=2665">VIDEO: TOP TEN CONSOLES OF ALL TIME - The Last Boss</a> and (<a href="http://digg.com/gaming_news/Video_Top_Ten_Consoles_of_all_time">Digg: Top Ten Consoles of all time</a>) I decided to rank the consoles on how they really should be ranked. These are based on the impact the console had on gamers and society alike. I'm not going to include the current generation (XBox 360/PS2/Wii/DS) since their place in history isn't set yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Super Nintendo</a><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation">Sony PS1</a><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive">Sega Genesis</a><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2">Sony PS2</a><br />
<br />
<br />
3.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Gameboy</a><br />
As one of the best selling systems of all time, the original Gameboy brought portable Tetris to the masses. Although several companies tried to dethrone the Gameboy (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx">Atari Lynx</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Game_Gear">Sega Game Gear</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboExpress">Turbo Express</a>) no one was able to effectively compete. The Gameboy could be compared to the Apple iPod. Limited in it's capabilities to its competitors, but what it does it does right.<br />
<br />
2.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a><br />
Due to Atari's arrogance which almost single handedly killed the video game market, Nintendo was able to release a system that brought video games past the fad stage.<br />
<br />
1.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">The Atari 2600</a><br />
Anytime you rank all the consoles, if this machine is not number 1, then the list is bogus. The Atari 2600 was a cultural phenomenon, much like the buzz the Wii is getting today. Gamers and non-gamers alike flocked to this game system to move pixelated squares around the video screen.
