Well nothing really special happened today. I took a test in Calc, I think I did well. Last night, <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/nwofreestyle/mainpage.html">Kwik</a> and <A HREF="http://groovemaster.livejournal.com/">Ben</a> came down and we had a lobby bemani party. <A HREF="http://groovemaster.livejournal.com/">Ben</a> was here till 10pm and <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/nwofreestyle/mainpage.html">Kwik</a> was here until like 12am or so. It was fun.

I also got <A HREF="http://www.sega.com/games/xbox/post_xboxgame.jhtml?PRODID=10079">Panzer Dragoon Orta</a> which The Berb has playeed a LOT more than I have. I haven't even tried the game.
