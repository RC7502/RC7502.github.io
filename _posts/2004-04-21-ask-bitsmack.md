<b>Best game of all time of the week</b>
<br />
Yesterday I picked up Viewtiful Joe for the Gamecube. This is the best side-scrolling action game I've played on a next-gen system. Granted I can't think of another 2D game but that doesn't make it any less awesome. In addition to the standard kick, punch, jump formula you can also slow down and speed up time. Slowing down time is my favorite because it makes your punches and kicks much more accurate. If you have a Gamecube I highly recommend buying this game.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040421.png' alt'' />
