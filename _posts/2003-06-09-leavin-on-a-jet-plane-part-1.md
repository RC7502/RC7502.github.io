<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=294>Today's comic</a> is the first part of my aeronautical escapades.

Goz said the site would not become anarchy while I was gone and yet what do I find when I get back? The comics have been replaced with these disturbing moving images that involve the Village People and me placing my hand into a very provacative area of E. Honda. Anyway, I'm back and proud to bring you some classic Bitsmack comics.

<b>Toilet seat covers: sewn by Lucifer, implemented by women</b>
<br />
Saturday night I went to a co-workers house to watch game 6 of the Stanley Cup. Yeah, I know its a sport but I'm branching out. Anyway, when I try to use the restroom I find this seat cover attached to the toilet lid like a parasitic life form. What purpose does this thing serve? Do some people actually say "I think I would sit on the toilet lid more if only it were comfortable." Hypotheses aside, I lift the lid and the seat to its full upright position in order to accomplish optimal beverage evacuation. Suddenly, the toilet seat falls, just fractions of an inch away from my Master Sword. It's then that I realize the purpose of this porcelain infestation. This is just an elaborate scheme by women to keep the toilet seat down. Why else would these seat covers be made out of thick shag carpeting? It is time this conspiracy is brought to the light. I can only wonder what other seemingly innocent household devices are tools in the female underground revolution...<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030609.gif' alt'' />
