Over the weekend Kevin Smith <a href=http://www.newsaskew.com/>announced</a> that he would begin working on a sequel to his 1994 film Clerks. I am hoping that the proposed title "The Passion of the Clerks" is a joke. I am half-hoping the entire story is a joke. If you watch An Evening With Kevin Smith he specifically states that he has no interest in making a sequel to Clerks. "Do I really need to do another 90 minutes of Dante saying I'm not even supposed to be here today." 
<br />

<br />
Even though I'd rather see Kevin Smith do something else, will that keep me from watching Clerks 2? No. I'll watch anything Kevin Smith brings to theaters or DVDs. Clerks 2 will be funny even though that may be hard to realize right now.

Btw, the Clerks 10th anniversary DVD and Jersey Girl come out next week.
