The <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=448>similarities are astounding.</a><br />

After the problem with WoW Tuesday I must not have got logged out the server properly because it wouldn't let me log back in with that character. So I started playing my Undead Mage on Skullcrusher. It was a nice change of pace and playing the Horde side I get to do quests I haven't done before.<br />
<br />
Also did anyone see Lost last night? Wow that show just keeps getting better.<br />
<br />
<b>Update:</b> Maybe I should specify that for me to get a Mac Mini you have to follow the link, sign up and then complete one of the offers listed. Just signing up doesn't count. I hope this clears up any confusion. I also took down the iPod Shuffle link. I'm not greedy, if I got a Mac Mini that would be awesome enough.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20050224.png' alt'' />
