Will Smith in a superhero movie, that sounds like the perfect combination! Well, it turns out to be a good combination. Hancock is the story of an alcoholic with super powers who ends up causing more damage that he prevents. He meets a publicist played by Jason Bateman who talks him into cleaning up his act and become a real hero that people like.

I think what I liked most about the movie are some of the issues is touches upon. At one point Hancock saves someone but the way he does it causes a lot of damage and people yell at him and threaten to sue. It's not the "thanks Superman" you get in comic books. The special effects are incredible and are used nonstop throughout the movie.

My only complaint is that the movie didn't have enough funny moments even though they had two great comic actors like Smith and Bateman. There is one specific scene that is supposed to be funny but just comes across as really disgusting. Even without the jokes the movie is very interesting from start to finish and there are some good plot twists that I didn't see coming.

Overall I thought Hancock was a great rental. It's not quite a "must own" movie like Iron Man or the Spider-Man series. I hope they make more Hancock movies because it's nice to see an African American superhero besides Blade, Handiman and Ghost Dad.
