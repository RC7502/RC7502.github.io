Ever since school started it has reminded me of the importance of friends. My friends come in many ages and sizes from my parents all the way down to some of my HS buds. These friends I can do ANYTHING with without worry of ridicule, anger or hate. They just care that we have fun regardless of the norm. Crazy hangouts at GH, walking to Ron's when we can't find anyone and Ron's not even home, random Bemani parties even with just one other person, random calls during the day of ppl just bored and wanting to chill in m sweltering room, Adult Swim nites, DDR tournies, POP n Music nites, IIDX Marathons, Guitar Freaks Sessions, and just chilling, whenever wherever. My true friends are there for me whenever I need them and mom and dad I don't tell them a lot but they're great too.

For all my true friends (including RC and Goz even tho they're related as well) you guys ROCK! I now know the value of friends. Thanks for making my life less boring and stressful.

One other note, I reserved a few more games for Matt. FFCC and Castlevania. That's about it.
