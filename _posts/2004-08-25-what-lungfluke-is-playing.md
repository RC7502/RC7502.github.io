I don't seem to be important enough to merit a "What lungfluke is playing" sidebar on this site, but, that's OK, as my list would be updated even less frequently than Gozar's, if that's possible.  (Civilization since 1993, Master of Orion since 1996, and Zelda Ocarina of Time since 2001).  But, in case you're wondering, here's what's up with me...
<br />

<br />
I finally finished <b>Wario Land 3</b> on my Game Boy.  I enjoyed it quite a lot, and highly highly recommend it.
<br />

<br />
I picked up <b>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</b> for the Game Cube over the weekend, used, at Movie Gallery for ten bucks.  Very cool.  Beautiful graphics, easy movement, nice music, and violent-but-not-gory fighting.  Unfortunately, it hasn't taken me long to get stuck, so now I'm off to gamefaqs.com......
