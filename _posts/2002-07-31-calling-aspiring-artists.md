Due to my recent computer problems I need comics to post on BiTSMACK. If you can draw and you want your comic to be seen, send it in. You can use my characters or use your own. Comics must be in gif or jpg format and not use harsh profanity. Make sure your name and the title is somewhere on the comic. Email your submissions to <a href=mailto:gueststrip@bitsmack.com>gueststrip@bitsmack.com</a>
