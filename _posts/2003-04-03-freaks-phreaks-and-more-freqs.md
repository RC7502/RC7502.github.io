I am 9 songs away from completing <A HREF="http://www.us.playstation.com/games/scus-97258/">Amplitude</a> on Insane difficulty! Some may say i've even gone insane! I have never had to hit buttons so fast in all my life! In other news not much has been going on. Findlay may be getting <A HREF="http://www.ddrfreak.com">DDREX</a> next week which should be pretty exciting. Other than that Finals are a few weeks away, I leave for Florida in two weeks and I have class in a half hour.

K-dogg out!!
