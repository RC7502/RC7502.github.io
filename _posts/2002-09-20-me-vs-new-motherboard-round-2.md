Awhile back I was having problems with a new motherboard I bought so I sent it back. Well I got the motherboard back and after a few problems I finally have my new machine up and running. 700 MHz is a large improvement over my 4 year old PII 333. Right now I am downloading the new UT2003 demo to put my new machine to the test.

<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=54>Today's comic</a> is referring to this new card reader attachment for the Game Boy Advance. Apparently you can buy NES and Game & Watch games on cards that you swipe through. It sounds pretty cool. Even though I don't have a GBA yet, if they release a lot more of these games on cards I might be tempted to get one.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020920.gif'   />
