Now that Lost is over I decided to watch the whole series from the beginning and blog about it. 

I remember clearly wanting to watch the first episode of Lost when the show started. All I knew was that it was going to be a show about a group of people stranded on an island. I thought it would deal with what they have to do to survive and the conflict within the group. I had no idea what I was in for. 

The show opens with Jack's eye opening, the first thing he sees is Vincent the dog, just like in the finale. There is wreckage on the beach and mass chaos. The first time I saw this it was like nothing else I've seen on tv. 

Ashley's note: so far not enough Sawyer in this episode and the one scene he was in he was wearing a shirt. I roll my eyes and continue the blog.

A lot of people online complain about how Lost never gave us answers. So to prove that we did get some answers I will list them throughout the blog.

Question 1. What is the scary noise coming from the woods?
Answer 1: We now know it is the smoke monster
Q2. Why was the plane so far off course before it went down?
Q3. How did a polar bear get to the island?
A3. The Dharma Initiative brought animals to island for experiments, including bears
Q4. Why was Kate arrested?
A4. She killed her abusive step father
Q5. What is the source of the French radio transmission that has been broadcasting for 16 years?
A5. A French woman named Roussau landed on the island years ago and she set up the transmission 

So from the first episode 5 questions came up and we'll get answers to 4 of them by the end. We might get an answer to Q2 I'm not sure yet.
