Well I ordered the X-Arcade last weekend and it's here already! I put pictures of it in the photo gallery. Unfortunately, some of the emulators I was using would not let you remap the exit key Alt-F4. There are a couple workarounds I could try. The X-Arcade allows custom configurations that I could map to Alt-F4 but the switch is on the back of the controller and I wouldn't be able to easily get to it once its mounted. I could also use some kind of keyboard mapping program to make Alt-F4 a different key, but I haven't done much research into this.

I have decided instead to remove all of the emulators except for MAME. I want to focus on getting as many good games working as possible. Because of the 3 day weekend Brad and I have decided to enter phase 2 of the project: putting everything in the cabinet. Goz bets us we can't get it done. We'll see who's laughing Tuesday!
