This movie is a twofer, you can watch it at Halloween OR Christmas. Anyway, the film opens in a forest. There is a tree for every holiday that acts as the gateway to a world based on that holiday. We never see Thanksgiving Town but I assume all the people there are morbidly obese. We travel to Halloween Town where they prepare for Halloween all year round. Jack Skellington is the Grand Pimp of Halloween Town. Everyone loves him but he's grown tired of Halloween all the time. There's also this girl that is held captive against her will by a mad scientist which I think is a little dark for a kids movie. But it's ok because she poisons his food in order to escape.

Jack wonders off and discovers Christmas Town which he thinks is the greatest thing ever. He sings my favorite song "What's This?". Jack decides Halloween Town is going to make their own Christmas and give Santa a year off. Their version of Christmas looks and sounds like how I imagine goth kids celebrate the holiday. Jack has 3 kids kidnap Santa but they are loyal to the Boogyman so they take Santa to him. Jack and his friends start delivering toys in Christmas Town but end up scaring everyone instead. Christmas Town has a police station and airfield, how much crime is going on there anyway? Jack gets shot down so he decides to give the real Santa back, but he has to rescue Santa from the Boogyman. He succeeds and Santa goes home and Jack ends up with the girl for some reason.

Overall I think this movie is visually amazing and the music is also really good. I give it a 4 out of 5.
