April 1st is the one day to avoid every news site you normally read. Everyone thinks they're so clever because they made a fake news story, like they invented April fools. Here are some of the fake stories floating around the net:<br />
<br />
<a href=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/10349.html>Enterprise saved from cancellation</a><br />
<a href=http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/01/149212&tid=3&tid=10>Apple offers prizes for companies to port games to the Mac</a><br />
<a href=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/04/01/news_6121444.html>John Woo to direct Katamara Damacy movie</a><br />
<a href=http://psp.ign.com/articles/592/592428p1.html>Sony ships 1 million PSPs to the US</a><br />
<a href=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/04/01/news_6121449.html>Mario blamed for teen's turtle topping rampage</a><br />
<br />
To summarize, while the media lies to us every day, on April 1st it is much more blatent.
