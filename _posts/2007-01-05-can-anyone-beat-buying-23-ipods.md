<a href="http://torants.blogspot.com/2007/01/cupertino-i-may-have-problem-pre.html">ToRANTs: Cupertino, I may have a problem (A pre-MacWorld story of how I came to purchase 23 iPods over 5 years)</a>:
<blockquote>That was the start of my ongoing love affair with the iPod. I love music and love being able to control my listening experience but surprised even myself the other day when I was asked during a conversation about the upcoming MacWorld, somewhat as a joke, how many iPods I have purchased over the years.</blockquote>
And I can't justify upgrading my first generation iPod to something newer, even though the refurbished pricing at the <a href="http://store.apple.com/">Apple Store</a> looks very enticing ($150 for a black or white 4GB nano).
