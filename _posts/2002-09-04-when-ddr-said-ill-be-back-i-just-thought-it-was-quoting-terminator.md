As kruton posted several times last week Dance Dance Revolution has returned to the Findlay mall. I decided to do a <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=48>comic</a> about it. What are you looking at? You think I'm only doing a DDR comic because there is nothing else to do is this town. Well I'll have you know... uh...

Anyway, last weekend I got a chance to see the first episode of the new He-Man cartoon and Transformers Armada. He-Man looks like it was completely remade. Since I haven't seen the original in over a decade its hard for me to compare. This new one seems a little more grown-up, I thought it was pretty cool. Transformers Armada on the other hand just plain sucks. Here is actual dialogue from the meeting room where a bunch of corporate pricks thought up Armada: 
<br />
<br />
Prick #1: We've got a dozen shows just like Pokemon and we need a way to trick males 18-24 into watching. 
<br />
Prick #2: Why don't we call it Transformers? When I was in high school dating cheerleaders and being a dick to all the nerds I remember them watching that show. 
<br />
Prick #1: Won't the young males notice that the show is nothing like the original Transformers?
<br />
Prick #2: Why the hell should I care what a bunch of nerds think?
<br />
Prick #1: Good point. Wow... putting crappy shows on TV is exhusting. Let's go play some golf, and admire each others BMWs.
<br />
Prick #2: Sounds good. Then tomorrow I have an idea on how we can ruin Go-Bots. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020904.gif'   />
