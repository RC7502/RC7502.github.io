Cinciclassic was pretty fun last weekend. Having a table was sort of exhausting though. We did get some good video recorded that I will work on editing and get posted on the site. I got 1st and Goz got 2nd in the Warlords tournement. Goz won Feet of Fury for the Dreamcast and I won Disgaea for the PS2 and the Legacy of Kain Collectors Pack for the PS1. I didn't buy any video games but I did pick up a Nintendo T-Shirt, a PS2 T-Shirt, a used PSone, a brand new PSone screen and an Odyssey2 complete in box. Look for more updates this week.
