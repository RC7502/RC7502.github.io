I usually avoid Gamestop at all costs but they suckered me into pre-ordering Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 so that I could get a code to play as Juggernaut. As I was picking up my game yesterday I was able to witness the following exchange. In the first corner we have the poster boy of geek stereotypes: black dirty t-shirt, greasy hair, overweight, has a voice like Butthead. In the other corner we have the gamestop employee: early 40s, receding hairline, reeks of desperation, probably a manager. 

Geek: I wanna get Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2
Manager: Did you preorder it? (this is a question employees ask to determine if the game is in stock, if you answer no usually they are conveniently out of the item) 
Geek: I think so, can you see all the games I preordered?
Manager: You have preorders for (lists off about 4 games that came out anywhere from a few weeks to several months ago), but not Ultimate Alliance.
Geek: Ok, just cancel all those preorders and put the money towards Ultimate Alliance.
Manager: YOU WANT ME TO CANCEL 4 PREORDERS!?

Apparently if you cancel a preorder at Gamestop, whichever employee is on duty that day gets flogged in the back room. I wasn't aware of that. I don't see what the big deal is, the guy bought 1 game instead of 4. They still had his $20 earning interest for them for all those months.
