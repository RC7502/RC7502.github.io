My wife and I are very different people.  I am the Ã¼ber-geek type; she breeds and raises horses.  Why we should ever have hooked up is, frankly, a mystery to me.  But, she wears glasses, drinks beer, and can operate an automobile with a manual transmission, so that qualifies as "irresistibly hot" in my book.

Well, she just got a little bit hotter.

After we tuck Junior in bed for the night, we go our separate ways for the eveningâ€” she watches whatever is on TV that night, and I usually dink around on the computer.  Well, over this past weekend, I had finished my evening's dinking, so I  circled around to her to see if she was ready for bed.  Imagine my delight to find her parked in the comfy chair, simultaneously watching TV and playing the Game Boy!   Now <em>that's</em> hot.
