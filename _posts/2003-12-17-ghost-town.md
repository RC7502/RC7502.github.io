I'm back to three comics a week, but you probably won't see <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=367>today's comic</a> because you're too busy watching Return of the King. 
<br />

It appears just about everyone I know went and saw the new Lord of the Rings movie last night. I want to go see it if I can find someone else that wants to go. I won't go to movies by myself, its just too weird.

Anyway, Christmas is about a week away and I'm really not that excited. My job has been sucking the last couple months, my love life is nonexistant and I'm just generally bored. I'll take up the role of Scrooge and bah humbug my way through New Years. Rudolph, Frosty and the Ghost of Christmas past would have to fight off a horde of Nazi Robots to save this Christmas. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go set up my Festivus pole.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20031217.gif' alt'' />
