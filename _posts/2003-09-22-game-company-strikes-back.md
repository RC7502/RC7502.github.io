Recently Gamespot gave the new PC game Savage a low score. The company that makes Savage struck back by looking at the log files and finding that the reviewer had only played the game a couple of hours. Gamespot has since removed the review and posted <a href=http://forums.gamespot.com/gamespot/board/message?board.id=basic_pc&message.id=181034>this statement.</a> I found this story funny because while I may review a game after only an hour or two, these people are actually getting paid to do this. What do you guys think? <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpBB2&file=index>Discuss in the forums.</a>
