About two more and <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=414>I</a> could form my own Justice League.

There's not much going on besides me working on my MAME cabinet. I think The Rogg, Brad and I might be going to Wizard World this weekend. It'll be worth it for me just to meet Eliza Dushku. Plus I want to do some shopping which I didn't get to do last time. I used to collect comics but all the titles I used to read have ended. If I want to read them now I'd probably just get the collections instead of individual issues. I'm more interested in reading the stories now than collecting. By the way, there was a really good documentary on comic books on the History Channel about a week ago. I would check your local listings because I'm sure they'll rerun it. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040518.png'   />
