I hope all of you are as excited as I am about DDRMAX American edition which will be out on November 5th!! (from my last recollection) I'm geared up and ready to party!! This will be the first GOOD (hopefully) mix to come out in America for consoles and is said to conssist of 65 songs (I'm banking on some will be from older Japanese mixes) WOW that will be a LOT to play!! Konamix only had like 54 From selected older Japanese mixes. Finally I won't have to swap CDs to play a Decent mix. This mix is supposed to be built on the DDRMAX game engine (USA was on 1-3 engine, Konamix-4th engine, Disney-"Gettin High" Engine ;} ) I of course have had this game reserved since b4 Warcraft 3 came out and WILL be there to pick it up on the day it comes out.
