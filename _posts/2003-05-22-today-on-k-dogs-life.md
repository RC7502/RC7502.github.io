I'm tired.
<br />

<br />
Tired of Ebay.
<br />

<br />
As my wish list grows smaller and smaller, it get's harder and harder to find what I want. My list has dwindled down to about less than 10 items. 
<br />

<br />
*Drummania w/controller
<br />
*Drum 2nd/Guitar 3rd
<br />
*Pop N Music Best Hits
<br />
*Beatmania Arcade controllers
<br />
*Pop N Music Arcade Controller
<br />
*Vib Ribbon
<br />
*Keyboard Mania controller and game
<br />

<br />
Not a lot of people know what Vib Ribbon is so I think I'll explain it. Vib Ribbon is a rhythm game where you control a rabbit-like character who follows a line that creates shapes of a square, triangle, X, and circle and you have to hit the button accordingly. The beauty of Vib Ribbon is that you can use custom soundtracks! Select music swap and you can eject the game disc to put in any type of music CD you want to. The game reads ahead on the CD and detects different movements in the song to make you hit buttons at certain times! It's simply beautiful.
<br />

<br />
As for other stuff, not a whole lot is going on... I'm fully moved into my new apartment and yes, Pop N Music 7 still owns me :)
<br />
.Hack//Mutation is still awesome but I can't stop playing Pop N 7th!!
