As you can tell by <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=385>this comic,</a> my boycott of Blockbuster has ended.
<br />

<br />
"What boycott?" you may be asking. When I lived in Findlay I was a regular customer at Family Video because a new release was only $3 for a night and during the week I could get an older title for free. After moving to Columbus a year ago all I could find were Blockbuster and Hollywood Video. I went into Blockbuster to rent a movie and found that I couldn't rent a movie for any less than three days and it was about $8. Why would I ever need a movie longer than a day? Do I really want to watch Men in Black 2 more than once? Because of this I haven't rented a movie in the last year. But now, at least in the Columbus area I can rent a movie for one night for $3. Now I can finally catch up on all the movies I have missed. Btw, Lost in Translation is a little overrated and Jerry Seinfeld Comedian is very interesting.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040218.gif' alt'' />
