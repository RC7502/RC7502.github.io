After seeing the news posted by Kruton6, I went over to <A HREF="http://www.sketchers.com">www.sketchers.com</A> and sure enough, they have a TV commercials link in their menu. When I clicked it, another menu popped up and at the top was a link titled DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION! To see the commercial, click <A HREF="http://www.sketchers.com/tv/fall2002/index.jhtml">here</A>. You must have Quicktime to view the commercial, however, as the movie isn't compatable with windows media or Realplayer.  Enjoy!!!
