So Russ (I don't call him RC) has been saying for a month or so that I should start writing for Bitsmack. He thinks that because I'm a girl and not a geek, people will actually be interested in what I have to say. We'll see how that goes. My first "assignment" was to recap the season premiere of "Lost".

Let me preface this recap by saying that I've only seen, like, 5 episodes of "Lost" before. I used to occasionally watch it with my old boyfriend Jason and our roommate Justin. I was always confused, and I always tried to ask questions, but Jason would always hold up his hand and say, "Shh, Lost is on." By the time the commercial break came, I couldn't remember what my original question was, because I had a bunch of new ones. Russ and I watched a Dane Cook stand up the other day, and he said "Lost" was his favorite show, but he was always thinking, "WTF is going on? I have a million questions, and no answers." That's exactly how I felt, and I'd only seen a few episodes. I don't know how people can keep watching it. Not because it's a bad show, because it just doesn't make any sense.

That being said, this is my take on the season premiere.

<!--more-->So it starts with an Asian man making what I'm assuming is the orientation video. Some construction worker guys find a wall that melts tools and made another guy bleed, so the Asian guy told them to leave it alone, because it could cause time travel? I wasn't listening that closely. Then another guy showed up and spoke to a construction worker. I don't know who he was, but it made Russ go, "Oh, snap!"

Then it cuts to Charlie, who's name on this show is Jack, but I was a big fan of "Party of Five", so I want to call him Charlie. But I can't, because I think there was another Charlie on this show, so that would just be confusing. So he shall be CharlieJack. CharlieJack is talking to Ben in a funeral home, and they have to take the old dead guy....somewhere. The island? It disappeared though.

Three years earlier, there was a great light, and the island disappeared. Locke (the old dead guy) is now apparently alone. Another Asian man, forgein lady, the "Oh Snap!" guy and a Steve Buscemi lookalike are on their boat. Sawyer (-drools-) and Juliet are still on the island. They can't see the freighter or the helicopter and wonder what's up. They find Bernard and Rose, whoever the hell they are. They're a little panicked because the camp is gone.

"Oh Snap" guy's name is Daniel. He's a physicist. He tells them their camp isn't gone, it just hasn't been built yet. Because Ben pushed a giant wheel, and turned back time. I gathered that from the preview before the show.

Kate is raising Claire's son, Aaron. I don't know what happened to Claire. Angela Chase's dad ("My So-Called Life") shows up with another guy, asking for blood samples from them to find out how their related. Apparently, you found out in a previous season that CharlieJack was Clarie's half-brother, and he used to be engaged to Kate. She basically tells them to f*** off, and slams the door in his face. Kate panics, so she packs up her and Aaron's crap and they bail.

Sawyer and Daniel get into it. Sawyer wants a shirt, Daniel says no, so Sawyer bitch slaps him, then threatens the redhead. Daniel tries to explain what's going on, using a record metaphor. Because kids nowadays totally know what a record is. He tells them either the island is going back in time, or the people on it are. Makes perfect sense. They then realize that Locke isn't with them.

Locke decides to go for a hike, but clearly doesn't really know where he is. He sees a plane crash, then finds a Virgin Mary statue on the ground. He decides to go check things out, and finds the plane in a tree. He calls up to see if anyone's in it. There's no answer, so he starts climbing the tree. Then someone starts shooting at him, and he falls. Some guys bursts out of the bushes with a gun, and demands to know who he is.

I've been informed by Russ that the man with the gun is Ethan, one of the Others, who was killed in the first season.

Ethan's pissed, and thinks Locke came on the plane. He tells Ethan that he didn't, Locke tells Ethan than Ben appoints him as their leader. Ethan says, "Bulls***" then there's another light.

Now it's back to Sawyer, Juliet, Daniel and friends (SJD+F), and it's dark. Daniel tells them their either in the past or in the future. Way to narrow it down.

Cut to Sun. She's flying to Los Angeles, but something's messed up on her passport. A guard locks her in a room, and Caleb Nichol ("The O.C.") shows up. They discuss their "common interest", which is to kill Ben.

Ben and Jack are watching TV, and learn that Sayid killed someone and busted Hurley out of the looney bin. Sayid is apparently killing a bunch of people to avenge his late wife's death. Or something.

Sayid and Hurley grab some dinner and go to a hotel (or so it looks). Not in a "special friend" way, they were just on the run, and it was late. Sayid talks about working for Ben, and advises Hurley to never talk to him or do what he says. He realizes there's people in his room, and Sayid takes them out, while Hurley waits outside. Sayid flips one guy over the balcony, and pushes the other on top of the open dishwasher. Ouch.

Hurley still waits outside, holding a gun. I was writing, so I didn't see how he got it. I'm guessing from Sayid. A group of guys walk over and see the dead body. One takes a picture of Hurley, clearly holding the gun, with his cell phone, and they run off yelling about calling the police. 1) Hurley's already supposed to be in a mental ward, so a picture of him with a gun is NOT going to help. 2) Personally, if I saw a man with a gun and a dead body on the ground, I definitely would not be taking pictures, or telling THE MAN WITH THE GUN that I'm calling the police. That just doesn't seem like the best way to stay alive. But that's just me. Anyway, Hurley grabs Sayid and go back to the car. Hurley says, "We never should have left the island."

Seems to be a recurring feeling for these characters.

Back to SJD+F. They don't know where in time they are, but they know the plane crash happened already. Daniel spouts out a bunch of crap that none of the rest of them seem to follow, except that they can't change anything, and they can't stop anything.

Maybe Locke can change things, because the previous scene ended with Sawyer asking who could change things, and it immediately cut to Locke. Foreshadowing? With this show, who knows. Anyway, we find him on the ground, still in the fetal position and injured from being shot in the leg. No sign of Ethan, as far as I can tell, though. Apparently he's back in the present/future/whatever. He tries unsuccessfully to fix himself up. Someone by the name of Richard walks by. Locke seems surprised, but relieved to see him. Richard helps fix up the bullet wound. Locke asks how Richard knew he'd been shot. Richard said Locke told him. Locke says, "Nu-uh!" and Richard shrugs and says, "Well, you did in the future" and pulls the bullet out. He gives him instructions on cleaning the wound, then tells him the next time they see each other, Richard won't recognize him. He gave Locke a compass and said, "Give this to me next time you see me. Oh, and get those six people who left to come back, and everything will be fixed. You'll have to die in the process, though. Sucks to be you."

Then Locke is back in the past. But has the compass.

(Unrelated Side Note: Why the hell is Grover from Sesame Street making an appearance on Scrubs?)

SJD+F hear an annoying noise and there's yet another bright light, and then it's daytime again. Juliet finds the hatch, which apparently means they're in the past. Sawyer's frustrated and starts ranting about God knows what. He wants Desmond to let him in somewhere (the hatch, I'm guessing). He gets in Daniel's face, upset about everyone he cares about being dead. Except they're not dead. But he doesn't know that. Russ says he wants Sawyer to put a shirt on. I'm fine with him not wearing one.

Daniel points out that the redhead has a nosebleed. He starts to panic, but she insists she's fine. I'm sure that means something, but I don't know what yet. He sends her ahead with the group, then grabs his journal out of his bag and starts reading. He looks anxious, then goes and knocks on the same door as Sawyer had. A man in a full body rain coat, Desmond, comes out with a gun, and Daniel tries to explain that he needs to go back to Oxford and find his mother so that people won't die.

Bright light. Again.

Desmond and Penny. Desmond wakes up, claiming the previous conversation with Daniel was a memory, not a dream. He doesn't really tell Penny much, other than that they're going to Oxford. Score one for Daniel?

Thus ends Hour One.

On to Hour Two.

Three years ago. The Oceanic Six are on a boat, I guess trying to decide the lie they're going to tell everyone when they get back. Hurley wanted to tell the truth, but CharlieJack said people would think he's crazy. Sayid wanted to side to Hurley, but ultimately they decided to stick with the lie.

Cut to "present" day (and I use the term loosely). Hurley's freaking out because Sayid's passed out from his fight injury. Hurley got pulled over by someone who's apparently dead. His island girlfriend's friend, I'm told. She tells him to get his act together, get new clothes, and not to get arrested. Good advice.

There's Bernard and Rose again. Their first appearance since the first 5 minutes of the first hour. Steve Buscemi and the foreign lady are with them. I was wondering where they went. Russ's psyched because Sawyer put on a shirt. Daniel emerges from the woods, and Sawyer's annoyed. He grills Daniel, wanting to know what the plan is. Daniel's a little jittery, and says before they do anything, he needs to figure out where in time they are.

Hurley tries to wake up Sayid, unsuccessfully, so he robs him instead. He goes into a drug store and buys a t-shirt that says, "I â™¥ Shih-tzus". The woman behind the counter recognizes him from winning the lottery and being in the plane crash, but not from the gun picture, which was all over the news. Of course, the story was running on the TV behind her. He denies he's the same guy, and rushes out.

Aaron whines about wanting to go home. Kate contemplates calling CharlieJack, but doesn't. Then her phone rings from an unknown number, and she's surprised at who it is. The person is in L.A., so I'm going to guess it's Sun. But I've never been good at guessing games.

Ben pulls something he'd hidden out of a vent ("Veronica Mars" flashback, anyone?), then tells CharlieJack that he flushed his pills. He tells CharlieJack to get a suitcase and to pack anything he wants in it, because they're going back to the island and never coming back. CharlieJack agrees. Hands in, and break.

Cheech sits down eating probably the grossest sandwich known to man, along with some chips and grapes. (Yes, I'm paying that much attention.) Hurley shows up with a passed out Sayid, and says, "'Sup, dad?" Apparently the show's casting committee didn't realize that Cheech and Hurley were of different races. Not saying there's anything wrong with it, I'm just saying I don't think that's genetically possible. Maybe he's adopted. I don't know, I haven't been watching the show.

Hurley tells Cheech he's on the run again. They were in a safehouse, not a hotel. Hurley tells his dad they're in danger. Cheech says, "From who?" Hurley pauses, then says, "That's a damn good question. I'll ask Sayid when his dart wound heals up." Cheech says Sayid needs a doctor, and Hurley's eyes light up. Isn't CharlieJack a doctor?

Kate and Aaron are in a hotel I believe, and I was right! They are visiting Sun. They say hello. I bet that scene took forever to shoot.

Ben goes to a butcher shop, and asked the female butcher to watch something for him. She's apparently in on the whole plan. Whatever the plan is.

Bernard creates fire! And there is much rejoicing. Then he put it out. Steve Buscemi whines. Juliet roles her eyes. The redhead gives Daniel a mango, and mention she has a headache. I'm sure it has something to do with her nosebleed. She's apparently starting to forget things, so she asks Daniel if he knows what's happening to her. He avoids answering the question because the Asian guy comes back with a boar. Steve Buscemi flips the hell out for multiple reasons (wouldn't you be cranky if you were stuck on an island and didn't know where in time you were?), and he's shot with a flaming arrow. Random.

Everyone starts running from the flaming arrows, which seem to be coming out of nowhere. Juliet stops to help someone, and Sawyer goes, "WTF woman! He's dead! Let's move!"

Cheech asks Hurley if he's crazy. Real fatherly. Cheech calls him out on lying, and Hurley says there's a reason. Then his mom comes in and says Sayid isn't breathing. But he really was. They load up Cheech's car, and he drives off.

Kate and Sun have tea and discuss their kids. Typical small talk. Then Kate tells Sun that someone knows they're lying about things, and tells her about how Graham Chase wanted the blood sample. Sun tells her it's not about the lie, because they'd just go public and not talk to her privately if it was. She said whoever these people are just want Aaron. They have a heart to heart about how Kate was supposed to save Jin, but wound up saving everyone but him. Kate apologizes, Sun says, "What for? BTW, how's CharlieJack?"

CharlieJack meets Cheech and Sayid in a parking garage, and CharlieJack says he's taking him to a hospital. Cheech argues, then says "Fine, but you can't play with Hurley anymore, because you're a bad influence." Then CharlieJack calls Ben and tells him he has Sayid. Ben has the same expressionless face he always does.

Hurley's mother grills Hurley about who Sayid is. Hurley says he's a ninja. They have a mother/son conversation, and it sounds like a mother talking to her seven-year-old son. Hurley breaks down and tells her they all lied about what happened after the crash. He starts telling her the entire story, and with every word, he sounds more and more insane. And even he doesn't understand everything that's happened on this show. She says she doesn't get it, much like the viewers, but she believes him.

Sawyer and Juliet go for a walk, and hear someone else walking, too. They hide, and see someone go by. It looked a lot like when Richard walked by Locke. There's three of them, though. One grabs Juliet, one grabs Sawyer. Each have a knife to their throat. Then a guy who looked about 17 holds a gun to them and asks why they're on their island.

CharlieJack brings Sayid to a hospital and tries to fix him up. Sayid shoots up out of the bed and tries to choke him, then realizes who he is, and says, "J/K" and lets him go. CharlieJack says Cheech brought him, and that Hurley's with his parents. Sayid asks if anyone else knows he's there.

Hurley's about to enjoy a nice Hot Pocket (apparently unaware that it will be so hot that it will destroy his mouth) when Ben shows up. Ben tells him that he's going to take him to Sayid and CharlieJack. He says that if Hurley goes with him, he can go back to the island and he'll never have to tell a lie again. However, Sayid told him earlier to do the opposite of whatever Ben says, so Hurley runs out of the house and confesses to all of Sayid's murders. Good stuff.

The 17-year-old is asking Sawyer and Juliet questions, and not really giving them a chance to answer. Sawyer says he'll answer their questions, and then Mr. 17 orders the guy who has Juliet to cut off her hand. She screams, Sawyer tells them to wait, the guard raises his sword (or knife, whatever it is), and something came flying through the air and pelted the guard in the face. The another one got taken out, and Sawyer attacks the third one. Then someone jumps out and stabs one of the guards. Lo and behold, it's Locke. He takes his knife back, and warmly greets Sawyer and Juliet.

A masked individual sits in a room doing math problems on a chalk board, then taps some things into a computer. She then goes up some stairs and meets Ben. She tells him he has 70 hours to get everyone to come back to the island, and if he can't do it, everyone is essentially screwed. (This woman, apparently, was in a previous episode. She told Desmond he couldn't change anything, because if he tried, it would still happen, just a different way. According to Russ.)

So I end this recap with.... What the hell is going on?
