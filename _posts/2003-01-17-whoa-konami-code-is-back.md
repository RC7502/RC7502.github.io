This is a special report from K-dogg.
<br />
On friday's episode of Extended Play on TechTV they reported that the KONAMI code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, Start) is now in Star wars Clone Campaigns for the Gamecube!!!
<br />

<br />
And now back to your regularly scheduled video game
<br />

<br />
(I'm hoping to complete Kingdom Hearts with the special ending this weekend :-D ) 
<br />

(Also the K-dogg has ordered new DDR pads this week)
