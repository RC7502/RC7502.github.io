I forgot to mention it earlier but I will be particpating in a Q&A at the University of Findlay Thursday night. Unfortunately the topic has nothing to do with "guys who rock at web comics" but instead it is about getting a career in Technology Management. I hope I can still make it entertaining, and hopefully I'll get to see some of my old UF friends. It starts at 7pm in Ritz Auditorium, and I think it's open to anyone. See K-Dog for more information.
