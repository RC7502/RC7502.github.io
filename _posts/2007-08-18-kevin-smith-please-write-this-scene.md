I was watching Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back today, and realized that there was an opportunity for a great scene that was probably never written. The dinner scene with Vader, Fett, Leia, and Solo would've been very fascinating. After Vader disarms Solo, the scene ends with Vader sitting down and the participants entering the room for dinner.<br />
<br />
What a missed opportunity! I'd love to just even read this scene, especially if it was written by Kevin Smith.
