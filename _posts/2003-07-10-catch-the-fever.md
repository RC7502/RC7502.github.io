Last night instead of doing a comic I participated in the most pathetic of television promotions. ABC Family held a "Dance Fever Machine" competition at the Polaris Mall to promote the upcoming show. Surprise surprise, the Dance Fever Machine is just a DDR machine with the logos covered up. Knowing how many DDR players there are in Columbus I expected the place to be packed. However, there were less than 10 people in the competition. The winner got two tickets to Las Vegas, and K-Dog got second. It was worth it to have free play on DDR for a couple of hours, but will anyone really watch this show? My guess is no.
