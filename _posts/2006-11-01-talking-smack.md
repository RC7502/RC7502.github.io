So I realized I haven't really posted about anything going on in my life for a long time on Bitsmack. There are times my job is so busy I don't have time to <em>read </em>the internet let alone throw crap into it. During one of these busy times I stopped posting and then after things let up forgot to get back into it. I think another reason was that this site is mainly about video games and I really haven't been playing games most of this year. The reason I haven't been playing many games is because I just have too many and I don't know where to start. I got caught up in buying games when I should have been playing the ones I had. (Why did I buy Half Life 2 when I didn't even like Half Life 1? Why did I buy Disgaea 2 when I haven't even started Dragon Warrior VIII?)

Last weekend I bought an XBOX 360 and having a new console reminds me of my simpler days. When I bought the Nintendo 64 I only had Super Mario 64 and I played the hell out of that game. I even got all 120 stars. When I got a Playstation I played Chrono Cross all the time. When I first bought the XBOX all I had was Halo and I played through that game. At times when I owned fewer games, I took my time and played them more thoroughly. Therefore, I made the decision not to buy another XBOX 360 game until I play through Marvel Alliance. I also decided to go through my video game collection and put a bunch on ebay. I will look at each game and ask myself "will I realistically ever play this game again?" The only exceptions will be the franchise games I want to hold onto like the Zelda games, Final Fantasy games, etc.

"But RC, didn't you bash the 360 last year? Why did you decide to get one now?" Those are great questions, <em>me</em>. XBOX Live has come a long way since I last played on it two years ago. Trying to describe why XBOX Live is great is like trying to describe to a Trekkie why making out with girls is fun. It's something you just have to experience first hand. The online service goes way beyond just finding three other dudes for a game of Halo, it's an online community where you can quickly and easily see what games your friends are playing and voice chat with them. The other night K-Dog and I were playing two completely different games but we could still chat with each other the whole time without interruption.

The gamerscore and achievement system is a little gimmicky but I think it is cool that every game contributes to your gamerscore and it gives you way to compare yourself to your friends (We used to do the same thing with a high score notebook back in the day). Through the Live Marketplace you can download demos of games and arcade games. The arcade games are awesome because you can earn achievements for playing classic games like Joust and Doom as well as play the games multiplayer.

I hope to update the site more often talking about what games I am playing as well as putting comics up. And as always Goz, K-Dog an I will be doing our weekly geekly podcast every Thursday night.
