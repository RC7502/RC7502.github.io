Locke has got a ring, I think he's going to propose to Leela. It looks like a Locke episode, maybe they should have called it Lockedown. 

On the island: The hatch goes into lockdown and supplies are dropped.
Off the island: Locke does some stuff for his dad and Helen left him. 

We never get an answer on who Henry Gale was. I think it would have been cool to see a flashback on how his balloon got to the island, kinda like we got with the Nigerian plane. In Locke's flashback he met Nadia. I think season 2 was all about connecting as many people as possible through flashbacks. At the end of the episode they find out Ben is not Henry Gale and it gets real. 

Ashley's note: she wants to see the next episode right away
