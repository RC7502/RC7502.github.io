I am a huge fan of Marvel Ultimate Alliance. When it came out it was the reason I finally bought an XBOX 360. I've played through the game close to 4 times to unlock all the costumes. When the second one came out I was really excited. They changed a lot of things in the new one. Some good and some ok. Here are all the Pros and Cons in this weeks <strong>GAME BREAKDOWN!</strong>

Pros:
- Graphics are way better. The whole game is much more polished than the first one.
- You can click the right stick to show you what direction you need to head next. This is nice for big levels or if you get turned around accidentally.
- No more gear. I thought it was a pain in the first game to swap gear around to everyone if I wanted to switch out my party. Also there was no easy way to see what gear was equipped to 33 different characters. Instead of gear you can equip 3 medals that boost stats on your whole party.
- Better Story. The first game I thought was a little long and tried to cram in too many different stories. I mean really we're going to travel to Hell, Asgard, the Skrull Planet and Arcade's Murderworld all in the same story? There is also a branching story in this new one which makes me want to play the game a second time. 
- Collectibles. If you're one of those people that like collecting trinkets this game is full of them. I also like that it displays a lot of progress bars on your stats throughout the game. 
- Fusion powers. Instead of Xtreme powers which could clear a room in the first game you now have fusion powers where you pick a teammate and do a devastating attack. The cool thing is when you pick your teammate they'll have the word "clearing" "guided" or "targeted" above their head which do different things. Clearing is like the Xtreme powers, they clear a room when you have a lot of small enemies attacking. Guided I don't use much but from what I understand it's like pointing a laser beam down a hallway. Targeted does a big attack on one enemy and is useful for bosses. 
- Cutscenes are like a great cartoon show. In both games the cutscenes are some of the best that I've seen in any video game. The scenes in the new game are good but so far I haven't seen anything a spectacular as the opening battle or the nightcrawler scene in the first game.
- Swapping characters or saving any time. In the first game you had to get to a save point to change characters or save your game. In the new one you can do it at any time.
- Juggernaut. I preordered the game to get Juggernaut and it was worth it. He has a really good charge attack and I've had him in my party from the beginning. Only problem is that I have not yet heard him say "I'M JUGGERNAUT BITCH!"

Cons:
- Camera. In the first one you could rotate the camera and zoom in an out with the right stick. In this one you can't zoom and sometimes you can't rotate. They try to rotate the camera for you to give you the most cinematic view but it doesn't always work. 
- Fewer characters and very restrictive on who you can pick. Once you pick which side of the Civil War you are on you lose some options for characters. However, you also can't pick a character if they are featured in a cutscene on the next level. For example, I wanted to use the Fantastic Four but Thing was unavailable. Then the next level I played he was in a cutscene and became available. Then I tried to use the Fantastic Four again and Reed Richards was unavailable! What's the point of having the Fantastic Four if I can't put them all in my party at once?
- RPG aspect stripped down significantly. In the first game each character had 7 powers and 1 Xtreme power and you chose 3 out of the 7 to map to buttons. This was very cool because you're going to have powers you don't like but this way you could always find 3 useful ones. In the new game every character has exactly 4 powers and you can't change them. Sure you can put points into those 4 however you want but it still loses the customization that the first one had. 
- Attacks still unbalanced. In both this game and the first one for some reason punching and melee combos always do more damage than power attacks. Shooting someone with a laser will take their health down a little, but punching them twice and ending with an uppercut will knock them out completely. The first one was ridiculously crazy when it came to melee weapons. Grab a spear out of a guy's hand and you were like a god knocking out bad guys. The new game doesn't have the melee weapons, you can only pick up things and throw them. 
- ONLY 2 COSTUMES PER CHARACTER! This one really bugged me because the reason I played through the first one so many times was to unlock all 4 costumes for every character. I really liked being able to throw a group together all in their 70s or 80s costumes. Also you could apply stat bonuses to specific costumes in the first one which you can't do in the second one. This goes back to the RPG aspect being stripped down. 
- Healing. You can store 2 healing surges that you can use to either heal or revive you or a teammate. However, there is no way to know what the health levels are on your teammates unless you switch to them or they are flashing red. I liked the first one where you picked up health from crates or bad guys and it just went to whomever needed it.
- Can't swap out a knocked out teammate. In the first one when you got to a save point you could swap out a knocked out teammate. Since there aren't save points in this one you can't do that. You have to wait until you finish the level completely or get a healing surge. 
- Menu is slower and clunkier than the first. I thought the first game had a menu that was kinda slow to navigate but eventually I got used to it. The new game is even worse. It takes so long to swap out a teammate or check powers on people. They did add a quick menu where you can assign points during battle but it doesn't give me enough info to make decisions. 
- Possibly a bug. Once you choose a side in the Civil War, when you get 50 kills with a hero you unlock their alternate costume. I played with Wolverine for awhile and the stats page still says 0/50 kills. With all the heroes it seemed like I took out way more than 50 before the costume was unlocked. I don't know what they consider a kill.

This game is very balanced in the sense that for every one thing it improved it made exactly one thing worse. If you took the RPG elements and all the characters from the first game and combined it with the great story and excellent graphics of the second game you would have the perfect Marvel video game.
