This was mentioned on <a href=http://www.penny-arcade.com>Penny Arcade.</a> Apparently Soul Calibur 2 is going to have one unique charcter for each console version.
<br />
 
<br />
GameCube - Link from Legend of Zelda
<br />
PlayStation 2 - Heihachi from Tekken
<br />
Xbox - Spawn
<br />

<br />
Generally I don't like fighting games. People who have the ability of memorizing button combos are apparently using some portion of the brain that I have already allocated to remembering Simpsons episodes and lines from Kevin Smith movies. However, I do like Soul Calibur for some reason. Could it be because they have cool swords? Possibly. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, if a game comes out for all platforms I would normally get the Xbox version. In this case I would probably get the GC version instead because Link is cool. Soul Calibur 2 is scheduled for release in August. You can read more information here:
