Ashley and I fell behind on our Christmas movie watching so we decided to do 2 in one day to get caught up.

<strong>X-Men Evolution - On Angel's Wings</strong>
It's Christmas time for Xavier's Gifted Youngsters. It makes perfect sense to introduce the mutant Angel during the holidays. He saves people and they claim they were saved by a guardian angel. Magneto tries to recruit Angel but he wasn't having none of that. At the end of the episode they show how all the X-Men celebrate the holidays.

<strong>The Simpsons - Miracle on Evergreen Terrace</strong>
It's Christmas time once again for the Simpsons. Bart gets up early on Christmas day to open his presents and inadvertently burns down the tree. Bart blames it on a burglar ("snow covers all") and the town comes to their aid. What I don't get is Ned, brings over a tree for the Simpsons and later on in the episode Bart is sitting in the corner with no tree. I've never seen a continuity error in The Simpsons before. The town finds out there was no burglar and the Simpsons become hated by the town. It all works out in the end in a way that is bizarre and heartwarming at the same time.
