<br />
In other news I got my <A HREF="http://www.buynshop.com">new DDR pads</a> today!!
<br />
The BNSUSA Extreme DX pads!
<br />
They are totally more responsive than my old ones. They also came with PC adapters and some assembly required. The insert was a huge dense foam insert and I had to put them in the pad. They really remind me of the Konami official DX pad. We'll see how they hold up. I just AA'd Era for the first time at home on them! I'm recommending these as my fav home soft pads! With the insert in they're almost like hard pads!! I'm going to try my pad covers and shoes hopefully tonight and see how they perform. If you've got $112 for a PAIR of DDR pads I recommend these!!

K-dogg out!!
