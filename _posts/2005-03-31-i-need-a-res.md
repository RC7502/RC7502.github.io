So I was sifting through the forums today and I found that Anime night has been a very neglected topic.  If anyone is interested in hosting and is in the Findlay area please post in the thread regarding information.  I would like to begin putting it back together so please leave suggestions comments or ideas so we can see what we can put together in the future.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I have been appearing in the current podcasted Bitsmack Weekly (Bitsmack Live) so I am not dead I'm just very busy.  I play WoW when I can and I'm still crusing the Japanese rhythm game scene.  My most current project is trying to get my machines moved to BG.  We'll see how that works out.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
I graduate in 29 days :(<br /><br />
I'm only sad because I lose both of my jobs which I have worked very hard at implementing new technologies and just asking why to people who think things are "THE ONLY WAY POSSIBLE".  I'll probably fall back on retail services if nothing comes availible before May....<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Anyway, I'm stayin alive!<br /><br />
K-dog out!
