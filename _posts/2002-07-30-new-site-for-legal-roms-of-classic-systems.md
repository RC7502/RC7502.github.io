<a href=http://www.consoleclassix.com/>ConsoleClassix</a> is a new site that allows people to download roms and play them on an emulator. What makes this site legal is that once you download a rom it is locked on their system so they can't "lend" out more copies than they have. You are essentially just "borrowing" the rom. They currently only offer NES games but they say they will expand to more systems. It is currently free to try during this beta test period, but will most likely become a pay service.
