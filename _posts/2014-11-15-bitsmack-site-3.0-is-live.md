If you thought Bitsmack had been abandoned you were only partially right! I've been working for awhile on moving the site from WordPress to a static site. I've been using WordPress for years but it really is overkill for a simple blog. I was tired of it getting hacked, having hundreds of spam comments a day, and constantly updating it. I am now using a static site generator called Jekyll. It is great because I'm no longer dependent on having a database and backend programming language. 

So what does this mean for you, the reader, if you exist? Bitsmack should load much faster now and since I am spending less time maintaining the site I will have more time to make comics. Stay tuned for some new comics and exciting updates!
