Yes folks, this weeks top addictions:
<br />
RC: GTA: VC
<br />
    Metroid Prime
<br />
    GF 3rd DM 2nd
<br />

<br />
K-Dogg: Age of Mythologies
<br />
        Para Para Paradise
<br />
        Beatmania IIDX
<br />

<br />
As some of you may know RC and I will be taking a trip to Defiance this weekend to try out their PPP (Para Para Paradise) because I seem to attract crowds while I play *ironically* and then are going to a LAN party.
<br />

<br />
As for the comic I made... It was representative of what happens when you have too many games to play, one game, being a jerk to all the others from all the hype of his own release breaks your other games and grows bigger while sprouting arms and making you play him until you beat him. Then you are released.
<br />

<br />
The 2nd Round DDR tourney was last week and here are the standings:
<br />
    SAL = 1st (!)
<br />
    K-Dogg = 2nd
<br />
    Bill = 3rd
<br />
and that puts the overall standings at:
<br />
    K-dogg 19 pts
<br />
    SAL 18 pts
<br />
    Bill 17 pts
<br />
So it's anyone's* game, and now I"m off to do more gaming!!
<br />

*Anyone is represented by a meaning such that anyone person of the three (3) people listed have a chance of winning, all other players can probably kiss their dreams of winning goodbye.
