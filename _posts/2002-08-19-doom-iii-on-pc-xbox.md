According to this <a href=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2877682,00.html>article,</a> Doom III will be released for XBOX, and only XBOX, after the PC version is released. This is good news for people like me who won't have a computer powerful enough to play Doom III, although the PC version will probably have better graphics. This should help me prove to kruton that the XBOX is better than GC. I think we both agree that for the price PS2 is the best.
