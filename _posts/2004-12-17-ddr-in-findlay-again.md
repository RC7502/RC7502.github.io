YES, I am finally done with finals!!  My last semester commences soon!<br />
<br />
As the title hints, my DDr machine may be moving from Club 180 and into K-dog's Findlay Game Room.  I'm not pulling out of 180 per say but I can generate a lot more revenue even though I'll have to compete with the Namco arcade for DDR market share.  This is all thanks to Al.  He's been nagging me lately to get DDR here so he doesn't have to drive to the arcade everyday and as always, my machine will STILL only be $.50.  I should be getting a confimartion email from my contact today to know for sure but so long as it fits through the gameroom door it'll be on campus.<br />
<br />
Someday I'll put DDr back in 180 but at this moment I need more revenue.   The money from 180 wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough to make me want to keep it there.  More revenue means more games.  I'm offically starting this as a business and I hope to return a profit by 2006.  I've put most of my own money as well as getting loans from my awesome parents for all this to happen, now if the Gov will float me for my first two years I can *sigh* pay them back in my third year.<br />
<br />
Graduation is going to be the biggest step for me.  With everything that's happening in Findlay I don't see myself leaving anytime soon.  We've got a large house that's only costing us around $250-300 a month each, arcade machines, computer support contacts and an amazing girlfriend who still has two more years of schooling here at the U.<br />
<br />
My goal is to be out of my fathers pocket on my arcade business by the end of next year.  That shouldn't be hard at all pending I get a good paying job after graduation.  I've got so many dreams for my mini-cades but it all lies in me getting a real job so I can enjoy these things.  I hope to become a bigger part of Bitsmack but my priorities are currently in my business and my life.<br />
<br />
As far as games go, I'm saving for another arcade machine.  I have purchased FF 1&2 and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories both for the GBA and have almost completed KH:CoM.  Last boss is really hard....<br />
<br />
Anyway,<br />
K-dog out!!
