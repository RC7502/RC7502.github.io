Ok, So my 1337ness being in Year 5 on FFCC has learned me a few thingers.
<br />

<br />
1) if it flashes when you hit it, it'll die (eventually)
<br />
2) When studying abroad on another persons memory card just give all gil, and items to the owner of the card. You can't take them back to your card.
<br />
3) The more people you play with, the harder the enimies (and greater the rewards)
<br />
4) If you have the life magic DON'T DIE!!
<br />
5) Using 3rd party GBA link cables may result in you not being able to use L&R if you have an SP.
<br />

<br />
I hate FFCC as it renders me incapable of doing anything else for about 6 hours at a time, but it's such a great game! I can still manage to put down the controller from time to time at least.
<br />

<br />
Get well soon Ronster!!! The gaming community needz you!
