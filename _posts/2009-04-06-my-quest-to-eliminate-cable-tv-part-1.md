Over the past few years I've really started analyzing where all my money goes each month. I paid off all my credit cards and finally paid off my car. When I look at my monthly bills my highest are the mortgage and student loans, then next highest by far is my cable bill. I get TV, internet and phone all through Insight and the bill is around $140. I would love to cut this down, but can I give up cable TV?

I grew up in the country and the only TV stations we could receive were over the antenna. We got ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX and PBS. We had to rotate the antenna depending on if we wanted to watch the Toledo or Columbus networks. I remember before Fox was even a network. The only time cartoons were on TV was Saturday morning. After Fox came around it was great because cartoons were on in the morning while getting ready for school and in the afternoon when I got home. In high school I did miss out on watching Beavis and Butthead and South Park, but I grew up just fine not having cable TV.

When I moved into my college dorm I thought it was great having cable. I watched music videos on MTV, Pop-Up Video on VH1 and stand up comedians on Comedy Central. I don't remember watching a ton of TV because my dormmates and I also had to fit in several hours of Goldeneye every night. 

After sophomore year I transferred schools and moved into my own apartment. I was barely getting by with my part time job so I only had the bare essentials. I had the most basic cable you can get which meant I was back to the networks. I didn't have high speed internet or a cell phone. I had one phone line that I used for everything. It was good enough. I recorded shows on my VCR while I was at work and that gave me things to watch.

I graduated college and moved to Columbus. Since I was making more money I got regular cable again. A year or so later I bought an HDTV and got an HD DVR through Insight. For the most part I am happy with it, although the DVR does screw up from time to time and it responds slowly when you press buttons on the remote. But the question is, do I really need it? Almost every one of my favorite shows is available online for free. I have Netflix which opens my options even wider. Also, how much TV should I even watch? It's nice to relax for a little while after work but I don't want TV to be the only thing I do from the time I get home until the time I go to bed. I would like to do other things. 

So my quest is to eliminate my cable TV which should cut my bill in half. My plan is to use rabbit ear antennas in the living room and bedroom so we can still watch network shows. Then use XBOX 360s to either watch DVDs or Netflix Instant. Phase 2 of my plan would be getting a dedicated computer to use as a media center. I've already purchased some of the items to get TV over the air and I will talk about those in part 2.

What do you think? Could you give up cable TV? How much TV watching is too much?
