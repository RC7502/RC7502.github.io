Since all I do in my free time is play World of Warcraft I decided to do a <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=440>comic about it.</a><br />
<br />
I have come to the realization that I cannot keep up with the amount of entertainment that I have. So now I am multitasking. I have my old laptop setup to use for AIM, I am playing Warcraft on my eMac, and I have a monitor hooked up to my PS2 so I can watch 24 Season 3. Since Season 4 started I need to catch up. This has doubled my Geek efficency! Once I get caught up on my DVDs will I dare take the next step of playing 2 video games at once? Only time will tell.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20050111.png' alt'' />
