Don't get me wrong, I like <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=402>EBGames,</a> but they just keep giving me reasons to make fun of them.

In my latest issue of GMR they had these coupons that don't actually save you any money at all. Basically you give EB your entire video game collection and they give you like $10 off something. Personally I never trade back games because you never know when you'll want to go back and play that game again. There are a few bad games that I ended up putting on Amazon and I got back at least half of what I paid for them. I'd like to see EB beat that. If you're one of those people who trade in five games to get one, don't let me stop you. While I don't trade in my games, I do purchase preowned games whenever possible.   <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040409.png'   />
