I think <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=429>this could work.</a><br />
<br />
So I see this Atari Flashback video game console at Best Buy and there are so many things wrong with it. Basically it looks like a 7800, has 20 Atari games built in and costs $50. Here's the first problem, IT ONLY HAS 20 GAMES! Atari Anthology just came out for XBOX and PS2 and it has 85 games for only $20. The only reason to buy this is if you have no other video game consoles. Maybe if it at least had an expansion port to add more games it might be worth it but as it stands the Flashback is nothing more than a bulky version of one of those TV Game joystick things.<br />
<br />
In other news I have started redoing the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=characters>characters</a> page. I'll keep adding people to it as I go. It seems like the Bitsmack comic has a cast of hundreds.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20041202.png' alt'' />
