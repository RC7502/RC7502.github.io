<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=41>Today's comic</a> approaches the exciting conclusion of the first adventure. For those of you think I am killing off K-Dogg from the comic don't worry, he'll be ok.

Overall it was a pretty boring weekend. I played DDR at kruton's Friday night. Saturday, I rented The Time Machine and Citizen Kane. You can read my full reviews by clicking "Read More." I beat <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=275>Parrapa the Rapper 2</a> which is by no means an extraordinary feat. I am really starting to get into <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=82>The Bouncer,</a> it's a pretty cool game.

Kruton's continues his reign of terror posting reviews for every game he's ever touched. If he smelled an NES cart in 1987 you can bet there will be a review posted about it.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020819.gif' alt'' />
