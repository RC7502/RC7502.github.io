<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=82>I like Metroid Prime.</a>
<br />

<br />
My initial impressions of Metroid Prime is that it is awesome. I think Nintendo handed Retro Studios a copy of Super Metroid and said "this is the greatest game ever, don't screw it up." And Retro Studios did not. The game is just like previous Metroid games in the sense that you are exploring one big world. The items you get along the way give you access to parts of the world that were inaccessable. Metroid Prime cut into my comic making last night so I took a shortcut. In fact, I don't know why I'm not playing it right now.
