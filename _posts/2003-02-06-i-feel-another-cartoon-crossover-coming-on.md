Goz and I got to hang out with the DevryGuyz Tuesday night. I think it's going to turn into a weekly thing for me. 
<br />
<br />
I also found out there is a DDR Extreme machine just a few minutes away from my apt. I'll probably check it out this weekend. Next weekend I'm looking forward to Daredevil. K-Dog and Kwik might be coming down as well.

Lastly, I don't know how many people watch Smallville but this weeks episode was pretty good. As the series has progressed we see Clark Kent as he goes through high school discovering his new powers. This week his new super power was he got a pair of balls and finally asked Lana Lane out. Granted, all hell broke lose and they never got to go on that date but at least it was nice to see Clark not being a wuss for once.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030207.jpg' alt'' />
