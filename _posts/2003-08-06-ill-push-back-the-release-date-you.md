Monday's comic was delayed until <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=315>today.</a>

<b>The best shows you aren't watching</b>
<br />
I've mentioned before how much I adore Cartoon Network's adult swim lineup. Cowboy Bebop and Trigun got me hooked on anime. Well now they have some new cartoons. 
<br />

<br />
The Big O (Sunday 11pm) is often compared to Batman. The animation style is just like Batman the Animated Series. It's like a big fighting robot cartoon with a slick 1940s look. 
<br />

<br />
Fooly Cooly (M-Th 12am) simply blew my mind. Words cannot describe this show. If I tried to tell you what it is about or why I like it, I would be degrading it by trying to give it definition. You must watch this show at least once.
<br />

<br />
Blue Gender (M-Th 12:30am) hasn't impressed me yet. A guy is frozen and wakes up to find the earth is infested with giant alien bugs. The humans that are left have (now brace yourself) giant robot suits. Granted they've only shown the first episode so I'm going to give it a chance.
<br />

<br />
If anyone is watching these shows, let me know in the forum. I need someone to talk about Fooly Cooly with.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030806.gif'   />
