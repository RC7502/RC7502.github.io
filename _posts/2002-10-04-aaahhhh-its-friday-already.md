Sorry this is late smackers but I just got all my HW done. DDR is fixed now!!! As some of you may or may not know the amp in DDR was going bad so the manager sent it in to get fixed and now it's back!!! YAY! Props to the Soul Calibur 2 warriors at the arcade. Clint with 600 leader of the green team, and Meatwagon with some odd number of kills leading the Yellow team. It's a very interesting battle trust me. And a BIG shout out to some of the new basic learners and newbies Angie, TJ, and Theresa, hope you all enjoy the game as much as I do ;)
