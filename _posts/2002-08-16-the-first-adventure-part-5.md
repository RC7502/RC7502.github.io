I decided last night would be a good chance to get back to some gaming. 
<br />
<br />
I started out playing <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=31>Nightcaster</a> for XBOX. It still isn't a great game, apparently games don't get better if you let them sit on the shelf. Then I put in <a href=http:modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=33>Project Gotham Racing.</a> I love being able to listen to my 311 and Bracket albums while I drive. Despite what kruton says, it is better than GT3. Lastly, <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=2295>Tennis 2K2</a> for Dreamcast is awesome. I don't play a lot of sports games but I've never found a more realistic Tennis game. I'll put my review up soon. 
<br />
<br />
For those of you wondering if kruton has gone insane with the number of reviews he's been posting lately, I can assure you that kruton has in fact lost his mind. I read his reviews as a call for help from someone trapped in the  darkness of his own madness. Read his <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=newestreviews>latest reviews,</a> unless of course you value your own sanity.
