I've been jaded with the last few seasons of The Simpsons. What was once a must watch show now feels like an obligation, like listening to an elderly person's war stories. However, yesterday I happened to watch an episode from just a few years ago and it was still laugh out loud funny. I then remembered why I loved the show.<br />
<br />
Homer: Got any of that beer that has candy floating in it? You know, Skittlebrau?<br />
Apu: Such a beer does not exist, sir. I think you must have dreamed it.<br />
Homer: Oh. Well, then just give me a six-pack and a couple of bags of Skittles.<br />
<br />
Marge: "Homer! Your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!"
Homer: "Yep, it'll do that."
