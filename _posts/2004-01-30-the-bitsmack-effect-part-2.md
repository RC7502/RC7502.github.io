<b>Inspiration</b>
<br />
Last weekend I got to see Brad from <a href=http://www.devryguyz.com>DevryGuyz</a> beat Megaman X in 1 hour 30 min. Not only does he beat the game but he gets every single weapon, item and secret. It was amazing. So when I got home I looked for a game I could beat. I found Ducktales for the NES. The first couple times I played I died a lot, but now I can beat it on normal in 21 min. I'm not done yet though because I know of a couple of ways I can cutoff some time, and I did die twice. Is there any game you can beat over and over again? Post about it.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040130.gif' alt'' />
