Next Generation has an opinion piece titled <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3755&Itemid=2">The Troubles of PlayStation 3</a>
<blockquote>Shortages of PS3 are going to be horrendous. We are not talking here,  about long lines outside retail outlets, but numbers that barely qualify as mass market.</blockquote>
Now I have no desire for a PS3, but can this be good news for anybody? Is Nintendo poised to win the next generation battle with the least powerful console?
