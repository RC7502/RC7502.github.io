You're so in love with FFT and you don't even realize that the NEW one is coming out!? All I have to say is I've been playing the ROM (in English) since Friday and I CAN'T WAIT to get mine!! I ordered the FFTA bundle pack from Nintendo Power. Best deal ever! I hope you've all enjoyed K-dog's list of games :)

K-dog out!

P.S. In other news if you missed the Hardin Co Fair, you're luckier than myself. I give the arcade a big fat 0 on a scale of lowest1-10highest due to the overwhelming price gouging that makes me wish I was buying gas at $2.00 a gallon. Winning a lizard from the game of chance in the arcade almost overshadowed HotD1&2 for $.50 a play! TC2 $.50, Police 911 $1 (!!), Crusin USA $.50, CT $.50, airhockey $.50, Lethal Enforcers $.50 and Carenevil $.25 just to name a few. Our fair was also taken over by Coca-cola this year. Pretty lame, I spent most of my time in my aunt's Store, Horse Country's tent on the grounds. The fair gets a 1 out of 5.
