<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=62>Today's comic</a> represents the new Bemani addiction kruton and I share. As he mentioned yesterday, at CinciClassic we had a chance to play a bunch of different rhythm games for the Japanese PS2. I have to say Drummania is my favorite. It was also at the Forest Fair arcade. So now I have to start saving up my money for a Japanese PS2. I'm thinking about selling some of my old games. I'll put a list on the site soon.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021009.gif'   />
