I got Beatmania IIDX 7th Style this weekend and have to say it's just amazing!!  This game marks the newest Beatmania IIDx release since 6th style in 2002.  The game comes with 88 songs to play straight out of the box and has very little unlocking to do.  The game adds 2 new modes of play:
<br />
Master Mode: You play through one of three sets (Light 7 Key(L7), 7 Key(7) or 7 Key Another(7[a])) and if you fail it deletes your Master mode game and you get to start over.  If you pass all 89 songs you unlock various songs and difficulties.
<br />
Class "Dan" Mode - All I know is there are 32 (16 single, 16 double) courses for this mode and it's supposed to be really hard.
<br />

<br />
A bit of history:
<br />
Beatmania IIDX Styles have previously been produced by <a href="http://www.konamijpn.com">KCEJ (Konami Computer Entertainment Japan)</a> who are known for the various CS (consumer) releases of Dance Dance Revolution, Para Para Paradise (1 mix, JPN Only, dead), Guitar Freaks/Drummania (2 mixes, JPN Only, 2001 newest release, and Keyboardmania (2 mixes, JPN Only, dead) (forgive me if I have forgotten one) 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.konamistudio.com">Konami Studio</a> is responsible for the Pop N Music series of games and is also responsible for Beatmania IIDX 7th style.
<br />

<br />
Currently AC (arcade) versions of IIDX are in the 10th production whilst Pop N Music is on it's 11th mix.
