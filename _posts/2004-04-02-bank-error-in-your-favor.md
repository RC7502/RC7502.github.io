I need <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=399>a new game.</a> And by "need" I mean "not required to sustain life".
<br />

<br />
I haven't bought a game in about a month. When that happens I start to get the shakes. I surf Gamestop and EB at work and browse the same stores after work. I think I can hold out longer. I want to go through all my games and play each one at least once. However, I don't even have all my systems hooked up yet and the PS2 has become the dedicated DDR machine. I'll have to get a couch for the basement before I can play Ratchet and Clank again. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040402.png'   />
