Our first adventure has finally come to an <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=43>end.</a> I could have made the story go on for weeks but I arrived at the point where even I don't know what I'm talking about.

I had some problems connecting to XBOX Live last night. Since it is just a beta test I can't expect perfection, however it did set back the "convince kruton to buy an XBOX" revolution by months. Instead I just played Chrono Trigger and worked on comics. 
<br />
<br />
I recently bought the Microsoft Strategic Commander. It is a game device designed to fit in the left hand and make keyboard shortcuts for RTS games easier. I tried it out with Unreal Tournament, but it just doesn't work well for FPSs. Although it does work really well with Paint Shop Pro.

Tonight kruton, Goz and I are heading to Easton for the unveiling of Apple OS 10.2. I expect to see the usual mix of the rich and the hippie. I know OS releases are notorious for ensueing "Animal House" style parties, but I am more excited about going to GameWorks and playing a little DDR. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020823.gif'   />
