So RC has told me this is my weblog.
<br />
So here I go:
<br />

<br />
Today, worked phones at the office.  Had some great missed call moments being the only one in the office.  Kind of annoying since I hate missing calls from users.  It's orientation day so everything is hectic.  At leas there's a LAN this weekend I managed to get signed up for in time :)  That should be fun even though everyone criticizes my rhythmic ways at the office. *sigh*  someday....
<br />

<br />
I've started playing IIDX again preparing for <A href="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-8g-70-36x-4-5-77-1-15-iidx.html">7th style</a> to get here in the next few days.  I want to see my <A href="http://vjarmy.com/iidx/viewuser.php?user=358">online scores</a> get higher and possibly become top 20 some day.  I finished off 4th style and sold on of my controllers so now I have one big ASC and one small conty.  I should just sell the other small and buy another <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=21188&item=8104205411&rd=1">ASC.</a>  I've been working a full day, working nightly for my client and playing till the we hours of the morning JUST so I can say I <u>STILL</u> play video games.  Rhythm consumes my life.  I don't even think <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy12/preview_6097934.html">FFXII</a> will pull me away from them.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully tonight will be a productive night of IIDX and apartment hunting with a side of paying the cable bill.  If not I guess I'll just be busy like usual....  Time will tell...
<br />

<br />
K-dog out.
