Amazon is selling a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-DS-Lite-Limited-Pink-Ribbon/dp/B001ELM5GQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_8?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1228145815&amp;sr=8-8">Nintendo DS Lite Limited Edition Pink Ribbon</a> for $99.95. I don't know if this is just a Cybermonday special though. Plus, $5 from the purchase fights breast cancer, and I don't know anyone who doesn't want to help breasts.
