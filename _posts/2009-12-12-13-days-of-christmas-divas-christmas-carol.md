This is a movie that Ashley had that I've never heard of. I'm assuming it's another version of A Christmas Carol. Vanessa Williams plays a singer who is a a bitch to everyone. Her name is, get this, Ebony Scrooge. She is <strong>literally</strong> black Scrooge. She treats her assistant like crap. He's Bob Cratchit. The movie opens with her performing in France for no other reason but to make a terrible french toast joke. Scrooge decides to hold a concert on Christmas day to get the tax break even though it pisses off her whole staff. Bob's son Tiny Tim is sick but he doesn't even have crutches or polio, what's up with that?

Scrooge's former partner Marley shows up in S&M gear and proves her ghostlyness using the finest special effects the year 2000 had to offer. Kathy Griffin plays the ghost of Christmas past. Ebony was in an Pointer Sisters like group and used to date Bob, which is a weird twist on the original story. Ghost of Christmas present is a guy with a British accent, a cowboy hat and 80s rock hair. I'm not really sure what the hell he is supposed to be, Bret Michaels? Instead of a ghost of Christmas future they just show a very special episode of Behind the Music. Makes sense for a movie put out by VH1. 

The movie ends as you would expect. Scrooge changes her ways, everyone wins. Overall it wasn't a totally terrible movie. I give it a 2 out of 5.
