I finally completed Professor Layton and the Curious Village for the Nintendo DS, which means I am legally allowed to write a review for it. I don't play all the way through a lot of games so if you see a review here on Bitsmack it means that this is a game that is well above average. Not only is Layton a great game it is my favorite DS game so far.

In Professor Layton and the Curious Village you play as Layton and his young protege Luke who have traveled to the small town of St. Mystere. Baron Reinhold has passed away and whoever solves the puzzle of the golden apple will receive his fortune. You explore the village, talking to people to find clues. Along the way many more mysteries pop up. As you talk to each person they usually have a puzzle they want you to solve. An example of a puzzle might be: "On a digital clock how many times in a day will there be three of the same digit in a row?" Each puzzle has three hints that you can buy using hint coins that are found around the city. 

The whole game has a whimsical mystery theme like Encyclopedia Brown crossed with Sherlock Holmes. The cutscenes are fully animated with voice dialogue. The puzzles themselves are challenging but not impossible. I am ashamed that I did use gamefaqs for one puzzle but that was it, the rest I figured out with the help of the hint coins. The game also abides by my number one portable gaming rule: the gameplay can be broken up into small manageable chunks. I like portable games that I can pick up and play for a couple minutes and then put away. Even though I beat the game I haven't found all the puzzles yet, I still have about 15 to get all 120, then there are bonus puzzles as well. 

The nitpicker in me can't give this game a perfect score. My only minor complaint is that all the mysteries you rack up early in the game seem to just solve themselves all at the same time near the end. I didn't really have to do anything to solve these main plot mysteries. Also the game is very linear, there is only one path to proceed through the game. These things aside Layton is still an excellent game and I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys logic problems or brain teasers.

<strong>Final Score: A</strong>
