Sun and Claire are on the beach. Sun has lost her wedding ring. On the other side of the island Ana Lucia is being a bitch to everyone. 

On the island: Jin looks for Michael while Sun watches a dog poop. 
Off the island: When Sun and Jin met it was like Lady and the Tramp. 

Michael decides to head inland to find Walt. Then the makings of a great action movie heads after him. One of them is a Korean hired goon, the other fights off African gangs. Jin and Mr. Eko are "Two Badasses". Coming soon to a theater near you. We get to see the legs of The Others in one scene but I don't know if it's Ben's group, or the kids, or some other group, or why some of them aren't wearing pants. This is never explained.

Ashley's note: She's glad Sun found her ring, because she goes crazy too when she misplaces her ring.
