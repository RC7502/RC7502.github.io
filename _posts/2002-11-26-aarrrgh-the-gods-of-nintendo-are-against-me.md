<P>So I'm trying to find out what all the hype is about with Metroid. Unfortunately, my NES is getting worse and worse with cartridges, so I installed a new connector. This makes it somewhat better, but it still is not 100%... In fact, I'm playing tonight and it just locks up on me.
<br />
<P>So I ask, what are the tips on getting the most out of my NES. (And don't say get a top loader, I don't want to pay the money and it doesn't have AV out). 
<br />
<P>I've already:
<br />
<LI>Replaced the connector
<br />
<LI>Started cleaning the carts.
