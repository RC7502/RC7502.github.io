Hello all.
<br />
I have a very important message for this evening.
<br />
It has come to my attention that a very important High School teacher of mine has come down with a very serious illness. He will be going into for treatment tomorrow. It seems that the problem may actually prove fatal if it has spread far enough.
<br />
I'm unsure what to other than I ask you all to pray, think about or do whatever it is you do to feel for the current situation. I'm a total wreck just to let you know.
<br />

<br />
I urge you all to not take life for granted and enjoy every minute of it. The person is only a year or to older than my own mother which makes it even harder for me. He is a father figure both to myself and his own children. Please understand my concern because this is something I would not wish upon anyone....
<br />

<br />
Take care all
<br />
