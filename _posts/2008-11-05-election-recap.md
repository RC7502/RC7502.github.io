As you readers are aware, Bitsmack is first and foremost a political blog. There isn't a day that goes by where we don't talk about swing votes, swing states, swing sets and swing dancing. Yesterday history was made and I just thought I would share my thoughts on the day.

I awoke at my usual time, forgoing my morning workout and using the extra time to head to the voting location before work. There was a line up and down a couple hallways of the local high school. When 8:00 came someone finally realized that students needed to use these halls too and our line was moved outside. An hour and 15 minutes later I finally arrived at my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">arcade cabinet</span> voting computer. The system was even easier than I expected. I don't know how old people have a problem with this but they can figure out slot machines in Las Vegas.

At 7pm, Ashley and I settled in with some Diet Coke and bag of Doritos and awaited the election results. I couldn't decide what channel to watch the coverage on, but then my decision was made for me when CNN busted out HOLOGRAMS. Yes, for the first time in history a reporter was virtually projected into a studio in another city <strong>for no reason whatsoever.</strong> I did like when CNN showed how different demographics voted in different states and they had cooler maps and touchscreens than the other stations.

Occasionally they would cut to Obama's victory party preparations and McCain's defeat party preparations. Young people cheered for Obama like he was a rock star while old people sat quietly and listened to a boys choir at McCain's. I think it was this point that I realized where McCain went wrong. This whole campaign he's done things the way they've always been done, but technology has changed a lot in the last 4, 8, 12 years. For the last year I haven't visited a website, read a blog or played an XBOX game without seeing Obama's face plastered all over the place. It's not that McCain didn't reach out to young people, it's that he didn't reach out to young AND middle aged people. I don't think this election was as much about race as it was about age. Our culture has been growing more youth oriented for the past few decades and now people are voting that way as well.

So what will change? Pretty much nothing. The economy will suck for years, the troops will still be in Iraq for years, gas prices will rise and Chipotle burritos will still cost over $6. At this point, the Republicans have all packed up their stuff and left Washington saying "let's see if you can do any better."
