If you couldn't tell the last picture is supposed to be William Shatner from that old Twilight Zone episode. The picture kinda sucks, but I didn't look very hard. You don't feel like a real loser until you are searching the internet for pictures of Captain Kirk.

<b>Compaq, if you didn't hate them already I'll give you a reason.</b>
<br />
Yesterday I went out to a client site to install software on a new workstation. One of the managers got a brand new Compaq laptop. This thing was close to top of the line and running Windows XP Professional. Straight out of the box it stalls several times and takes a few minutes to start up. The reason why, all the crap programs that come preloaded. You've got MusicMatch, AOL, virus software, the system tray is lit up like a Christmas tree. It also appears Microsoft's cleaner desktop idea has been thrown out the window because all these crap programs have to fling their icons out there like a monkey throwing poo. I understand that a lot of users who don't know better install all kinds of crap on their computer, thus degrading preformance. However, the way Compaq sends out their computers doesn't even give the user a fighting chance. My advice to anyone buying a new computer is to buy from a company that only preinstalls Windows. Your computer will run a lot better.
