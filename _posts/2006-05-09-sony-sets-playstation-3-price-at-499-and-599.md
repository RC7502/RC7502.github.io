<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/08/technology/ps3_pricing/index.htm">Sony sets PlayStation 3 price at $499 and $599 - May. 8, 2006</a>

Will the Sony fanboys be able to save enough pennies by Novemember 17 to buy a PS3? The price difference reflects the size of the hard drives, 20GB and 60GB respectively.

As the video game wars continue, I see a parallels with the computer industry. Ironically, Sony is Microsoft; Nintendo is Macintosh; and Microsoft is Dell. Is that confusing enough for you?

Nintendo is focusing on gameplay and innovation. The Wii's new controller will either redefine gameplaying or bury the big N. Couple this with a cheaper price than the other two and we just might have the winner for the upcoming holiday season.

Sony believes that they can drag everyone kicking and screaming into the blu-ray camp, and do it while copying features from Nintendo. Check out the quote about the controller:
<blockquote>While the controller looks virtually identical to the current PS2 controller, user wrist movements can also be translated into onscreen movement - "but it's based upon our industry standard controller, which has been enjoyed by so many gamers," said Phil Harrison, president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios.</blockquote>
Sounds like Sony has adapted either the Kirby or Warioware Twisted controller to go against the Wii's controller.

Microsoft, on the other hand, is that little kid that goes to the park hoping someone will play with them.

<strong>*Update*: </strong><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3150521">1Up has details on the cheaper unit</a>:
<blockquote><span id="intelliTxt">  As it turns out, a little examining of <a target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 0.1em solid darkgreen; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen; padding-bottom: 0.5px; background-color: transparent" class="iAs" href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3150521#">Sony's</a> announcement press release reveals the $499 model will lack support for Memory Sticks, SD and Compact Flash cards, no built-in Wi-Fi and will surprisingly have the HDMI output removed (necessary for achieving the much bragged about 1080p screen resolution).</span></blockquote>
Just as Microsoft has seen the lack of demand for their core system, this pretty much seals the fate of the Sony $499 PS3. There is no way I'm dropping $599 on a system, I'd rather hook a Mac mini up to my HDTV!
