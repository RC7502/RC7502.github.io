For those you who yearn for classic gameplay, you have to check out Ikaruga for the Gamecube. I've played the import Dreamcast version and now it has come to America with the Atari logo. Ikaruga plays just like a classic space shooter except that the graphics are incredible. You can read my review of the import <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=8817>here.</a> I highly recommend this game.
