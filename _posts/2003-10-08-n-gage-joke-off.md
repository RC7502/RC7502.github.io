Yesterday the worst <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=341>portable system</a> in history was released. Remember this date to tell your grandkids.
<br />

<br />
According to <a href=http://spong.com/index.asp?art=5632>this article</a> Nokia plans on selling six million units in the first two years. What the article does not mention is that 5.9 million will be bought by Nokia chief Ilkka Raiskinen's parents and the other 100,000 will be donated to mentally handicapped children. The funniest thing is how gaming magazines and websites try to maintain their objectivity and pretend the N-Gage is a real console. They all know it sucks but they just won't come out and say it. Honestly, I want to meet someone who bought an N-Gage, just out of pure scientific interest. It'd be like getting to meet Jack after he came home with magic beans.

In other news the shirts have been ordered. We should get them in a couple weeks.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20031008.gif' alt'' />
