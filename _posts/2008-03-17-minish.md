It was in the late 1980s when I first embarked on the addiction that is <u>The Legend of Zelda</u>.  The entire NES system was so much more powerful than the 2600 I had played previously... and so I played Zelda day and night.

Unfortunately, what with school, parties, and this darned woman who managed to insert herself into my life, the Zelda-ing took a back seat.

Years later, I got an N64, and <u>Ocarina of Time</u>... I played this for quite a while, but again, with other obligations that go with being a responsible adult, I was unable to complete the game.

Same story for <u>A Link to the Past</u>, <u>Oracle of the Ages</u>, <u>Oracle of the Seasons</u>.

*sigh*

But... one night last week, I finally conquered my first Zelda: <u>The Minish Cap</u>.  Sweet.

There are a lot of reviews for this Minish game over at gamefaqs.com, and most reviewers say that while the game is good, it's over too quickly.  To which I respond... Huh??!?  It took me months to ply my way through the  Minish dungeons.  Have I no hope of ever finishing <u>Ocarina</u>?
