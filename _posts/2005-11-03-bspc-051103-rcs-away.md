<a href='http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20051101-5510.html'>Microsoft to artificially limit availability of the Xbox 360</a>
Microsoft is banking on the buzz of the Xbox 360 selling out. I guess that means the 360 will follow in the footsteps of Cabbage Patch dolls, Beanie Babies, and Tickle-me-Elmo.  Just think if Microsoft was a dairy, "I'm sorry, but we're not producing anymore milk today. Your best bet would be to check Ebay." And on Ebay you'd have these people trying to sell gallons of Microsoft Milk.
