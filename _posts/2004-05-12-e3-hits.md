Greetings!
<br />
In the heat of E3 K-dog has returned to give some fantastic listing to RC's already great information set.  Here it goes:
<br />

<br />
<A HREF="http://www.konami.com/usa/press/kr2051204.html">Karoke Rev 2 Song List</A>
<br />
<A HREF="http://www.konami.com/usa/press/ddrultramix051204.html">MAJOR Ultramix Info</A>
<br />
<A HREF="http://www.konami.com/usa/press/ddrextreme051204.html">Full Extreme Info (but no song list :( )</a>
<br />
<a href="http://www.konami.com/usa/press/tmnt2051204.html">Turtles 2 full story!! (unlockable original game!!</a>
<br />

<br />
Well that's pretty much all I got for now.  Life's very hectic.  I'm working 2 jobs, trying to keep up with life and actually PLAY video games for my summer.
<br />

<br />
I have 2 arcade machines currently residing at Club 180 in Kenton Ohio.  Para Para Paradise 2nd Mix and Beatmania 6th Mix UK Underground.  Both games are $.50 per play and can be played when the club is open Friday and Saturday nights from 7pm-11pm.
<br />

<br />
I am currently moving apartments and haven't had much time to do anything else <a href="http://www.bemanistyle.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4786">(short of posting and entire listing of Para Para Machines in the US)</a>
<br />
but I want to give a huge shout out to <A href="http://www.vjarmy.com">NY Dan</a> because he's awesome and made me find out about <a href="http://www.pacmanhattan.com">Pac Manhattan</a> which I will be trying to pull off with RC's help this year at Lakeside '04.
<br />

<br />
More to come,
<br />
Stay Tuned! ;)
