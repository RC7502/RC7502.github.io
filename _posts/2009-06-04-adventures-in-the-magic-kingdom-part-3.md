The second day we headed to Epcot. The hotel gave us buttons that said "Just Engaged." It was kinda cool because people would congratulate us wherever we went. Unfortunately it rained the most this day, like as soon as we stepped into the park. Here are the attractions we saw...

<strong>Spaceship Earth
</strong>This is the ride that's inside Epcot's giant ball. It basically takes you through the history of communication from cavemen drawing on walls to the computers we have today. After the ride there were some activities to do. It looked like one was like an air hockey game except the table is the floor and you stand on it. 4 out of 5.

<strong>Ellen's Energy Movie
</strong>It was like they took a ride about dinosaurs and tried to give it a makeover to be about something else. it starts with a movie about Ellen Degeneres not knowing anything about energy. Then Bill Nye shows up because he is awesome and takes Ellen back to prehistoric time. The ride starts and you see some dinosaurs, then it goes back to the movie and Ellen knows everything about energy. It didn't really make sense but Ellen is funny so I overlooked it's flaws. 3 out of 5<strong>.</strong>

<strong>Mission Space</strong>
After going on rides like Snow White and Peter Pan the previous day I was pretty sure I could handle anything Disney could throw at me. Therefore I didn't heed the multiple warnings about Mission Space. It is a simulator ride and they give you an easy or advanced option. Ashley and I chose advanced. Once, we sat down in our simulators and I looked at the screen in front of me I was like "oh crap." The scariest part was taking off straight up and it really forces you back in your seat. After that it's not quite as bad. Luckily, it was a short ride. I am glad I did it but it was probably the most hardcore ride I went on. 4 out of 5.

<strong>Disney Character Pictures</strong>
After lunch it was still raining so we got pictures with all the Disney characters since it was inside. it probably took like 60-90 min waiting in line. The worst part is that the monitors above us only showed the same 4 or 5 cartoon shorts over and over. This is Disney, they have decades of entertainment, I think every line at every park should have TVs with a variety of cartoons to help pass the time.

After we were done with these pictures, one of the employees told us where a couple of the princesses could be found in the different countries. Ashley wanted pictures with all of them so we found Belle in France and Mulan in China.

For dinner we ate in the Aztec temple in Mexico. I was expecting tacos and burritos but it was fancier than that. I got something that was kind of like steak. There was also a ride based on The Three Caballeros. The girl in charge of the line let us go to the front and have our own boat so that was kinda nice.

We decided to go back early this night because the rain never let up.
