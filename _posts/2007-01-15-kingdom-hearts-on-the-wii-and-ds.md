<blockquote>From Go Nintendo, who picked it up from Neo Gaf, who got it from 2ch (see, we told you word gets around), Square Enix and Disney have agreed to put the next Kingdom Hearts on Nintendo consoles. That means the title won't be coming out only for the Wii, but possibly for the DS as well.</blockquote>
Now this will be sweet!
