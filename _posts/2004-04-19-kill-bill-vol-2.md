Luckily I was able to talk Goz into renting Kill Bill Vol. 1 so that Saturday we could see the sequel. It didn't have as much action as the first but it was still really good. Saturday night Brad and I went to the Funny Bone and saw Greg Giraldo do standup. I had seen him on Comedy Central a few times and he was really funny live.
