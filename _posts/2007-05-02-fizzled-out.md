Tuesday Night Live fizzled out pretty quickly last night. Gozar joined us for Gears for the first time. Him, Daddykin and chill won the first round of Annex vs. Kruton7 and The Berb. They also won the second round with an amazing come from behind victory. Kruton7 and chill won the third game despite their constant bickering over whether or not to let the enemy bleed out when down. Then after that Daddykin had to download a map pack, chill's 360 locked up, and The Berb and Kruton7 switched over to Crackdown. I had some trouble trying to download the map pack so I'll try again before next week.
