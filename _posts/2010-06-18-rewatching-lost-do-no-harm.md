We pick up from last episode with Boone dying all over the place. Jack uses his typical medical technique of kicking the ass of the patient until they come back to life.

On the island: Claire has a baby and Boone dies. Jack wants to cut off Boone's leg to save him because Jack can't let go.
Off the island: Jack married the mom from Modern Family and his vows were some nonsense about letting go.

Not really any island mysteries in this one. I thought it was nice that they killed off one character and another was born. 

Ashley's note: She thinks its crap they killed off a main character so early in the show and it wasn't Shannon.
