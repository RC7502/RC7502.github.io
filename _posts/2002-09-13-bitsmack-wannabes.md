A lot of people have said they want to be in the comic so I decided it was time to hold auditions, starting with <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=51>today's comic.</a> For those of you that asked the person in the comic is Amanda, a fellow gamer and student at The University of Findlay.

I added a new movie to the downloads section. It's something Goz and I made a few years ago and I recommend you check it out.

I almost forgot the Atari swap meet is going on in Columbus tomorrow. It's 9-3 at:
<br />
Oakland Park Community Building
<br />
980 Lenore St. 
<br />
Columbus, Oh
<br />
I'll put up my full report on Monday along with pictures, hopefully.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020913.gif' alt'' />
