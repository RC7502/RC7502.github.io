<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=394>3.0?</a> Ok, maybe more like 2.1.

After finally switching to the eMac for my main machine, Goz convinced me to switch to Flash for my comic. I mean, if it's good enough for Joe & Benji or whatever those guys names are, it must be good enough for me. I am still getting the hang of it and it's hard because I am such a perfectionist. I think these new characters kinda look like zombies and I completely forgot to give K-Dog glasses. The other advantage to switching to Flash is that eventually I'll be able to do a Bitsmack cartoon. What do you guys think of the comic? Is it worse or better than before?<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040322.gif' alt'' />
