My updates have been sparse lately and that's partly because I've got a pain in both hands from working at the computer. For about a month my ring finger, pinky and the side of both hands have been getting worse and worse. I've tried taking more breaks during the day and watching my posture but it hasn't gotten any better. So I'm going to take a break from the comic for a little while until the pain lessens. I'm also going to try lifting more. I have some comic ideas but after working 8 hours a day on the computer the last thing I want to do right now is get on a computer at home. If anyone has any suggestions or tips on how to deal with repetitive stress injury let me know.
