Bernard is ready to get off the island. Rose is happy on the island. And now we get their backstory.

On the island: Bernard wants to save Rose by making an S.O.S. sign on the beach. 
Off the island: Bernard tried every crazy way to save Rose from cancer.

Not a lot of island mysteries in this one, except Rose and Locke were somehow cured by the island. And Michael comes back at the end.
