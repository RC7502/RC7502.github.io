Wow, GamePro is running a positive article about <a href='http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps3/games/features/84257.shtml'>The 24 Things You Need to Know About the PS3</a>. I would re-title it to <em>The 24 Lame Things You Need to Know About the PS3.</em> The article delves into such mundane details such as the number of Kiosks available, that one led is dedicated to the hard drive activity, and the fact that the PS3 is "very, very shiny".<p></p>I want to know why Sony picked the Spider-man font for the PS3. Everytime I see PS3 stuff I think that it's pertaining to Spider-man III, not the PS3.<br>
