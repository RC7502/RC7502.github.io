Apparently Belle was trapped in the castle a lot longer than we thought. Most of the animate objects living in the castle are trying to get Belle and the Beast to hook up, but there is this computer generated pipe organ and his lackey flute who don't want that to happen. On a sidenote, how weird is it that Angela Landsbury is like a million years old and has a small child. How is that even possible? And who is the father, the clock? I suspected the clock and candle guy had a thing going on. Belle wants to celebrate Christmas but The Beast forbids it. Then the organ tries to kill them or something. I don't know, I was playing Braid. The songs weren't as good as the original and the story wasn't as interesting as the first. I give it a 2 out of 5.
