If you have read or written any reviews lately you may have noticed that much more of the games have pictures and a button to "Buy Now." That's all thanks to <a href=http://www.gamefarmer.com>GameFarmer.com.</a> Gamefarmer is a price comparison website for video games. They have all the new systems as well as NES, Genesis and Super Nintendo. I've been using the site for a couple weeks now and it is pretty nice. You can set up alerts for games you want to buy so you'll get an email as soon as the price drops. "When you get to $20, you'll be mine Animal Crossing!" Anyway, I recommend checking out this site if you want to get the best price on new and used games.
