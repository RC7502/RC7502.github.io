My friend Cassadi needs some extra cash so she is selling her Gamecube, some games, GBA player, some GBA games and a few other things <a href=http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=8121464047>on ebay.</a> If you don't have a Gamecube yet this would be a good chance because all of the games that come with it are really good titles. I might have to bid on this one myself because the games are so good.
