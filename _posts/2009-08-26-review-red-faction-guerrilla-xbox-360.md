I can only assume we're talking about metaphorical gorillas then. Anyway the story goes that you arrive on Mars looking for work and immediately your brother is killed. You respond to a death in the family the way anyone would, by leading a revolution of murder, terror and destruction to overthrow the government. It's the destruction part that makes Red Faction stand out among all the other 3rd person action games. Anyone can shoot a guy or hit him with a car, but bringing down a three story building with a sledgehammer and explosives, that's something new. 

The game is laid out a lot like GTA. You can complete missions to advance the story, or do side quests to build up your arsenal. The side quests include stealing vehicles, blowing up buildings in a time limit, rescuing hostages and winning firefights. The cool thing is that completing side quests boosts morale and the more morale you have, the more civilians will come and fight by your side when you need help. 

I found that the most fun I had in the game was sneaking into an area, then blowing up and smashing buildings until the authorities show up. The fact that every structure in the game is destructible reminded me of the game Blast Corps for the Nintendo 64, a game that had not occupied any part of my conscious mind for about a decade.  

I give this game a <strong>buy it</strong> rating. I don't always play through the entire game before I review it, but this one I did, and I can see myself going back for some achievements.
