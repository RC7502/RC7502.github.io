<a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/36460" title="Best Buy Bodhisattva | Gamers With Jobs">Here's the first hand account</a> of a teenager owning GH3, <i>Through the Fire and the Flames</i>, Expert:
<blockquote>
	<p>300 note streak.<br>
	400 note streak.<br>
	500 note streak.<br>
</p>
<p>	At about one minute in there is a pause, perhaps five seconds where the band's singer mumbles some 1980's era lyrics into a microphone. I've never particularly cared what he had to say. Kyle is absolutely motionless. There's no shaking out of hands, no turning to make knowing glances at his audience or worry about his hair.

	He blinks.</p>

<p>And for those that wonder how difficult the song is, here is a Youtube clip of someone playing it on expert:</p>

<p>I've been in those Zen-like states with Kaboom!, which is probably the same place these people are.</p>
