For those of you that are unaware, Phineas and Ferb is the funniest show on the Disney Channel. It's about 2 brothers who spend their summer inventing the coolest and craziest things. Their older sister tries to get them in trouble. Oh, there's also a platypus secret agent that battles and evil scientist.

Anyway, this time Phineas and Ferb are on Christmas break. The boys decide to build a rest stop for Santa to give back for all the presents he has brought over the years. They also want to decorate the entire town as a thank you card for Santa. However, the evil scientist (who has some weird name I'm not going to bother trying to spell or look up) invented a device to cause dark clouds to come over the town which somehow causes Santa to think everyone in the town is naughty.

Phineas and Ferb and their friends and two British elves decide if Santa's not coming they are going to deliver presents themselves. Everything works out in the end and the kids save Christmas. If you've never seen the show before I highly recommend it but as far as Christmas specials go its nothing spectacular. I give it a 3 out of 5.
