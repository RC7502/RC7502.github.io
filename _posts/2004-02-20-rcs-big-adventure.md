With RC on the move and me tucked safely away below my mountain of Bemani I think it's time to safely say what's on everyone's minds.... video games.  I played the new R-type Final yesterday and I have to say it is VERY cool.  If you're like me and hate playing on easy or normal I would suggest to you to go through this game on the normal setting before trying anything harder.  Why you ask? It's because the first level took me 2 continues to beat on the second highest difficulty!!  FFCC has lost a lot of ground in my gaming schedule because I've learned that I need to start going to work and classes more often.  Pop N Music 9 came out this past Wednesday in Japan and once that gets here I'll have to spend a week or two on it.

In DDR news, RC has recently purchased 2 Redoctane Ignition 2.0 pads and has promised me that he will be better than me after he moves into his new apartment.  Anyone who has seen me play and anyone who has seen how fast RC quits things can probably reassure us all that RC will NEVER be as good as me at DDR :-P

I think I'm gonna tear up the boards a bit and get back to what I should be doing.... sleeping!

K-dog out!
