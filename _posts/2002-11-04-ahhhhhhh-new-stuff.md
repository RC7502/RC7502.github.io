Finally Bitsmackers, I K-dog have returned.
<br />
I apoligize for the absence for a week but I've been very busy, it seems I was abducted by aliens and taken to their planet. They kidnapped me after Vice City was released and made me show them how to play the game. It was TERRIBLE!! They kept me well nourished and forced me to play for HOURS on end!!!
<br />

<br />
Well not exactly but that is one of the two very important reasons I haven't posted for a week.
<br />

<br />
The other one is named Max but we'll call him <B>FRED</b> so I can finish this post and I don't just quit typing and start playing with him again.
<br />

<br />
So last week was very entertaining. I went to the rock and roll hall of fame and found a way to wire the PSone screen to any game system I want to through PHONO (RCA) jacks. Vice City and <B>FRED</b> came out last week so I'm totally hooked right now and I have a new perspective on Animal Crossing and that is, It's really cool!!
<br />

<br />
So on a side note, I think the newsletter should have something about the TOP reviewers as well as the top 5 of the month...
<br />
I think the record of 119 reviews for a single user is very noteworthy!! 
<br />
Well hope you all enjoy this edition of the K-dog dispatch, see ya all on Thurs.
<br />

<br />
K-dog out!!
