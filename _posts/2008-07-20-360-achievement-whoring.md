Hello Bitsmack,
Long time no post.  I've got a new favorite past-time now and that is achievement whoring on the 360.  With sites like <a href="http://www.x360a.org">Xbox 360 achievements</a> which lets you login and track individual achievements by game <a href="http://www.easyxbox360achievements.com/Site/Home.html">Easy Xbox 360 achievements</a> which tells you what games to play and how to get the easy achievements and <a href="http://www.achieve360points.com/">Achieve 360 points</a> which has a great community of gamers and achievement lists, you too can become an achievement whore.

Much like easy 360 says sometimes you can glitch a game to get achievements (which I have yet to find a game to do that with) however sometimes the developer has corrected the glitch and so you have to play the game offline.  I play almost all of my "cheese" games offline.  Why? because mainly the extra noise generated by the pop-up notifications and the position it places the pop-up in, not to mention the few times I've dropped connection only to have my game reset on me and I lose the progress since last save (I'm looking at you DDR Universe!).

Many of you are asking "What's the point?  The achievement points aren't worth anything are they?"  To that I say what's the point of any game then?  You don't win prizes from beating Mario Kart or gain fame and fortune for beating Through the Fire and Flames on Expert Guitar or play World of Warcraft every waking minute of your life.  Mainly I do this because other people do it and it's a community thing but there's also the accomplishment factor from saying "yea I beat that game on every difficulty AND got all the goals the developer set for us (a.k.a. the achievements).  In addition to that I get to play a variety of games from many different genres and being that I'm playing for the achievements I have to work to master every game I play.

K-dog out!
