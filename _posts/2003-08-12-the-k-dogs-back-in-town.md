Well friends, it's been a LOOOONG time! I just got back from 4-H camp last week and now it's back to the grindstone. School starts in 2 weeks as well as several new titles I'm sure we're ALL looking forward to. 3 DDR console mixes are set to hit the streets by the end of the year, (2 Am 1 JPN) The TMNT game from the makers of The TMNT arcade game and the Simpsons arcade game, another installation of the .Hack series, XIII the cel shaded 1st person shooter, and many MANY more great titles!!
