I'll preface this by saying I have not read the book Twilight, nor am I a 12 year old girl. That being said Twilight was not a bad movie. It is the story of a clumsy awkward teen girl who falls in love with a vampire dude. It's like Buffy and Angel if Buffy's friends were vapid instead of witty and Buffy didn't kick any ass. It's definitely a love story first, second and third and a vampire movie last so don't expect a lot of horror/action. I know this hasn't been the most glowing review but the film is actually interesting and kept my attention from start to finish. I know they are setting these characters up for more movies based on the books and I am curious to see where it goes.
