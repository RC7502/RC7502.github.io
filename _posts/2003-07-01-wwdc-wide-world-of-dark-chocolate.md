So last week was the Apple WWDC in San Francisco California. I didn't enjoy the city of SF. There were lots of cool colors and I went to the Sony Metreon but there just weren't enough arcades or place that I like to shop. We went to the SF Mall and it was like 10 floors of clothing shops!! The only Techy place was either the Palm Kiosk or the As Seen on TV store!! No Radio Shack or Gamestop or anything!! The conference was pretty neat. We got the Dev preview of Apple's new OS "Panther" 10.3 and a sweet <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/isight/">iSight Camera</a> for <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/ichat/">iChatAV</A>. I'm working on setting it up to web cast my boring life ;)

<br />
I found one arcade that DID have a Beatmania III Append 7th Mix which gave me another opportunity to play my faves like 7000 Questions, Jack and Mark get busy (Everyone Wants a Piece of the Pie), and Fire Dub.
<br />

<br />
I've been playing a LOT of Pop N Music 7 lately and 8 is coming out this week! Mega Man NT for GCN came out and I haven't been able to pick up my copy due to me finally being back in town. I should be back in full DDR force in a week or two :)
<br />

<br />
Other than that nothing much is happening. The new addition to my apartment will be the GCN since I'm going to pick it up tonight and finally finish Metroid Prime courtesy of the Ronalopolis :) and actually give Zelda WW another chance. Man I hope I can finish Mega Man Battle Network 1 soon!! >:{

K-dog out!!
