A dark day in the land of humor as last weekends <A href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episode_guide/255.html">Season Finale</a> <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/index.html">SNL</a> episode announced that <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/bios/Jimmy_Fallon.html">Jimmy Fallon</a> is leaving the show.
<br />

<br />
Anyone who has seen the show knows that Jimmy Fallon has been co-host to <A href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/bios/Tina_Fey.html">Tina Fey</a> on Weekend Update and has also been a beloved charater for his holiday songs to various popular artist songs.
<br />

<br />

<br />
K-dog out.
