I stopped in at the local Gamestop to pick up a few DS games, and started talking to them about the PS3 and Nintendo Wii preorders. Apparently they didn't even sell out of the 8 PS3 preorders until 5:00pm, and the same for their 12 Wii preorders. <p></p>I'm assuming this is because a couple of factors. One is the fact that unless you follow the videogame industry, a majority of the people around here do not even know that new game systems are coming this fall. I overheard some high schoolers all pumped about the PS3, up to the point of actually getting a job so he could afford it. I wanted to walk up to him and tell him the PS3 is going to bomb, but who knows how these high schoolers retaliate these days.<p></p>Anyway, I kinda wish I would've gotten a PS3 preorder now, I could've made some sweet bank from Ebay in November.
