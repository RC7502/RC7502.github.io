With more locomotives, ships and personal autocars running on steam, some natureologists are suspecting a steam shortage within one or two score. According to Dr. Grant Mistingstein, "steam is a non renewable resource, once we use it all up we have no way to get more." However not everyone agrees with these findings. A representative of a the large steam conglomerate Steamxon says the worlds steam supply will last well into the twentieth century. Some people refuse to give in to the Big Steam propaganda and have begun looking into alternative propulsion solutions. "An ideal fuel source is right underneath our feet and it's called oil" claims Daniel Plainview, local oil man and liquid dessert enthusiast. He adds "Oil is continuously being generated at the center of the Earth. If we drill for it, more will just be made in its place. It's the perfect fuel."
