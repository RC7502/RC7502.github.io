I'm with America Online and I think they provide a great internet service. When you join, AOL gives you the first two months for free and now AOL can block Pop up ads.

Also, because my computer is five years old and slow, AOL sent me a faster modem. If you have friends or family who are considering getting on the internet, tell them about AOL.
