I'm still trying to figure out why Ben lied to Locke and said that he didn't push the button and nothing happened. Ben obviously pushed the button and he knows how dangerous it is, why would he want Locke to not press the button?

On the island: Eko and Locke search for the question mark from the hatch drawing.
Off the island: While Eko is posing as a priest he has to investigate a possible miracle.

In this episode Eko's brother appears to him in a dream and appears to Locke in a dream. I am wondering if the smoke monster has the ability to create these dreams for people on the island. Several of the characters have been having these dreams this season. The fortune teller from Claire's episode is back as the father of the girl who drowned. This is a cool episode because we get to see the station that monitors the Swan station. There is another orientation video that explains how the Pearl station monitors the Swan station and supposedly the Swan station is an experiment. 

Ashley's note: she officially does not like Michael anymore because he shot Libby.
