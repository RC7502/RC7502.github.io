There are some things from your childhood you can look back on in fondness. But there are far more things you can look at and wonder "why did I like that?" I will cover the latter of these questions in a new feature Cynical Retrospect.

When I was a kid the only TV we had was hooked up to an antenna and we got 5 channels. Therefore, I watched a lot of crap growing up. One show that I was really excited about when it premiered was Captain N the Game Master. "A cartoon about video games? I PLAY VIDEOGAMES!" I exclaimed. This is a premise that is sure to be awesome. And at the time I believed it was. However, I recently re-watched the first episode and realized how wrong I was.

Captain N is the story of a kid named Kevin, who lives in Zack Morris's bedroom and is on the Varsity Punch Out team at Nintendo Senior High School. He and his dog get sucked into a video game to help out a group of incompetent knockoffs of popular video game characters. There's Princess Llana who is a stereotype of every video game princess. Megaman, who is not blue and has to add the word "mega" to every sentence. Kid Icarus, who might as well be call Kid Puberty because of his constantly cracking voice, also he has to add "-maximus" to every other word which makes any dialogue between him and Megaman unbarable. And Simon Belmont from Castlevania, except that he is some vain, egotisitical, pretty boy. On the bad guys side you have Mother Brain embarassing the game Metroid, Eggplant Wizard (who I am told by wikipedia is a bad guy from Kid Icarus (a game I have never played but I assume involves trying not to fly too close to different things)), and King Hippo from Punch Out, who's green skin and giant nipples are way too disgusting to show to children or anyone with eyes.

Taking a break for a second, how did this show ever get made? I assume Nintendo was in on it since most characters are from their games. But Megaman is from Capcom and Belmont is from Konami. What kind of meeting involved Nintendo asking these companies "hey we would like to use your characters in our new cartoon, and oh yeah we would like to make them retarded"?

Moving along, the cartoon itself consisted of constant bickering between all the characters, slapstick, terrible jokes, and then Kevin shooting things with his zapper. Different episodes took place in different video games which I guess would make kids want to buy them? Except what would happen in the show would be so <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">stupid</span> different than the actual game it wasn't really a successful marketing attempt. If He-Man was a half hour toy commercial then Captain N was a public service announcement to promote playing outside with a ball.

Captain N was a good premise and hit at the height of video games, it's just terrible execution. I watched it on Netflix Instant, so if you must travel down that nostalgic, pot-hole laden road at least that method requires the least amount of effort.
