This episode opens on an eye, I think its Boone's eye. He doesn't like Sayid getting all up on Shannon. 

On the island: Locke makes Boone have a hallucination somehow that Shannon was killed.
Off the island: Boone has to rescue Shannon from bad dudes all the time because he has the hots for her.

I totally forgot to mention that a few episodes ago we heard the whispers on the island for the first time. We find out in the final season that the whispers are spirits trapped on the island like Michael. The cool thing in this episode is that there is a scene when Boone is at the police station and Sawyer is dragged in. We'll find out why in a later episode. 

Ashley's note: She still thinks Shannon is a bitch and thinks it is gross that they made out even though they aren't technically related.
