People, people, people!! I haven't played video games in over 48 hours!!! This is INSANE!! I can't believe I'm still alive!!! 
<br />

<br />
On another downside note, while I was driving back from a company party at the boss's house, my left speaker blew!!! Now most of you know, I love my music in my car, but without it I don't know if I'll make it home and stuff. Today I'm probably going to go out to the mall and buy some new ones. I'll finally have some good speakers for once!! Hallelujah!!!
