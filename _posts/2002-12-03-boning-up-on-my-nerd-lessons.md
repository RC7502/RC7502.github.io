Yup, last full week of school and then exams!! I'm so ready to be done. I don't have a lot to post so let's go over what games I'm hooked on:
<br />

<br />
1) Beatmania IIDX - A game that is immensly popular in Japan has made it into my big list of games I'm addicted. Any game that utilizes a controller that's bigger than the console system I'm using it on HAS to be great!
<br />

<br />
2) Metroid Prime and Fusion - Fusion is tougher than prime, Prime I've died like once, fusion took me like 4 tries to beat that security robot and I'm dedicated because I NEED to play the original on my gamecube without having to remember a bunch of stupid codes.
<br />

<br />
3)DDR - Yes, yes, I still play. With the winter months in full swing i usually get sick and cut back my play time which seriously hurts my game but I can still play R&P on maniac
<br />

<br />
Finally, I've got PPP and two controller now!! I just won the auctions on ebay and now I begin to cut back my spending and spend it on others for I must buy Christmas presents for ppl. Well other than that, LATA!
<br />

<br />
K-dog out!!
