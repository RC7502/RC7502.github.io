I'm a couple weeks late on this but here's what I thought. Up is an enjoyable movie. Not one of Pixar's best but even an average Pixar movie is better than most regular movies.<br /><br />Up tells the story of a old man who wishes to finally complete an adventure that he and his wife had since they were kids. It starts out with an excellent opening montage that shows the couple from kids to adults. Between this, Watchmen and Wolverine, 2009 must be the year of awesome opening montages. To get to this special canyon the old guy ties a few hundred balloons to his house and floats it there. The Mythbusters must be rolling over in their graves. A boy scout named Russell comes along for the ride. When they get there they find a rare bird they have to protect from a different old man. <br /><br />The opening to the movie tugs at the heartstrings, then it turns into a kids adventure movie, then it goes overly sappy again at the end. I think they over did it a little on the sappiness. Over and over again they would make references to some tiny thing at the beginning just to get an emotional response. These are just minor complaints, the movie is still pretty good. We went and saw it in 3D but there wasn't really a need to. It didn't take advantage of the 3D as well as Monsters vs. Aliens and through most of the movie I forgot it was even supposed to be in 3D. <br /><br />I rate this movie somewhere between "See it in Theater" and "Rent it" depending on how big of fan you are of Pixar movies.<br /><br />
