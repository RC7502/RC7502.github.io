This game was the reason I bought a Gamecube. I played Super Mario 64 until I got all 120 coins and I thought this would be pretty much the same game. It's not. They added this water pack thing that is pointless and the game is frustratingly hard. I've never even finished the main story. We'll see what happens this week when I have my revenge.
