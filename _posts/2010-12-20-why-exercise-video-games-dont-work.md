As long as there have been video games there have been exercise video games. The NES has a fitness game nobody played on the bottom side of the World Class Track Meet pad, and now 20 years later the Wii has Wii Fit, which no one plays. Has exercise gaming not gotten better in that amount of time or what? The technology has improved but I think the game makers are overlooking one crucial fact: <strong>people don't like to exercise.</strong>

Ok, so let's look at popular forms of exercise. You've got sit-ups, push-ups, running, biking, etc. Most people don't like doing these things and that is part of the reason the U.S. is so obese. But then, wait a minute, the Wii is released and now games like Wii Fit, Biggest Loser and EA Active are supposed to solve all our weight loss problems. However if you start up any of these "games" all they do are push-ups, sit-ups and yoga poses, <strong>the very same activities we already hate doing!</strong> The only difference between doing a push-up by yourself and doing a push-up in Wii Fit is having someone to count for you. It's like these games are trying to make exercise fun... by making it exactly like the exercise you already hate to do. 

The thing is, I believe a very successful weight loss game could be made, as long as they focus more on the game aspect. Dance Dance Revolution is probably the best weight loss game made so far. It is a fun game, but also you have to be in pretty good shape to be able to do the hard songs. The new Dance Central on the Kinect might also be a contender but I would have to play it some more. They wouldn't even have to be music based games, why not make a game like Warioware where you have to quickly do different moves. Make a game where I have to do some physical activity and then give me a score. That way I have something to beat the next time I play. I think there is a huge potential out there in fitness based games as soon as someone figures out how to really make fitness fun.
