I'm back everybody! I got Gitaroo Man from  RC this weekend and have played it a lot! I still have not beaten Super Mario RPG tho. I was catching up on my <A HREF="http://www.devryguyz.com">DeVry Guyz</A> reading and thought that <A HREF="http://www.devryguyz.com/new/ep039.php">this comic</A> was one that Lungfluke needed to read! :)

My <A HREF="http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?submit=manufactory&catalog=3&manufactory=1671&DEPA=1&sortby=14&order=1">WinCube</A> is beautiful and everything is great in the land of K-dogg! I leave for Florida on Sunday so I most likely will not be posting next week. School is out in a few short weeks and I have much to do so I'm out!

K-dogg out!!
