<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=58>Today's comic</a> is part 1 of our Squidfest report. Overall the event was a lot of fun and there was a good turn out. Kruton may have a better count, but I thought there was 30-40 people. We got to meet the guys who do the popular webcomic MacHall. Don't expect them to link to us anytime soon. They acted like they were a little "too cool" for us and probably won't even look at this site.

Most of the evening the attendees were playing one of two games: Battlefield 1942 and Unreal Tournament. Since my laptop wouldn't run Battlefield I was in the latter group. Although I did get to play Battlefield a couple times on kruton's computer. There was more stuff that happened but I got to save something for the rest of the week.
