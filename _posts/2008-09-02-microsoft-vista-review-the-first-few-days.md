The running joke seems to be how sucky Vista is and how it's better to stick with Windows XP. However, after my laptop got a nasty virus and had to be reformatted, I figured I would give Vista a shot. I had nothing to lose and could always reload XP if I had to. The laptop in question is a Dell Inspiron, about 3 years old, I can post the full specs later. <br /><br />Pros:<br />- Install process ran smoothly with little intervention.<br />- All my drivers were installed automatically. In XP I would have to download network card drivers to another PC and transfer them via USB stick.<br />- Runs fast. This could be due to doing a fresh install.<br />- I like when you hover over an item in the task bar it gives you a preview window of the item. <br />- Network settings show you graphically if there is a problem between you and the router or the router and the internet.<br />- Uses a Home folder structure just like the Mac. I like having a Downloads folder by default.<br />- Windows look nicer than in XP.<br />- Haven't had anything crash or used Task Manager to close anything yet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Network options are buried. Instead of right clicking on the icon and going to properties it takes 3 or 4 menus to get to TCP/IP settings.<br />- New gadget bar on the right side, I haven't decided how useful this is yet. Right now I just have CPU monitor and weather.<br />- The security messages do get annoying after awhile. It pops up a warning any time you change something in Control Panel or run an install exe.<br /><br />I started installing World of Warcraft yesterday so I will keep you updated on how Vista runs for gaming.<br />
