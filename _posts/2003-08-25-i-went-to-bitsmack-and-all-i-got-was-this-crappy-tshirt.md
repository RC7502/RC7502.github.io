Remember when I said I wasn't going to tell you when there was a new comic? I <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=323>changed my mind.</a>
<br />

<br />
I really am working on a design for a Bitsmack retro gaming tshirt. Once I get the design and prices finalized I'll be accepting preorders. I'm not using Cafepress to order these shirts so they will be cheaper and higher quality.

K-Dog, Lynex and I went to the DDR tournament on Saturday. I'm out of practice so I just played my Neo Geo Pocket Color. The mall did have a Beatmania 2nd Mix and that made the trip worthwhile for me. I'll let K-Dog post his full report of the tourney. He also took some pictures that we should hopefully put up soon. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030825.gif'   />
