Well this week looks to be DDR week for me as I have been playing a TON. My DWI folder is up to 404 songs now!! I was pretty impressed that someone made a <A HREF="http://www.bemanistyle.com">Fqhwhgads DWI</A>
<br />

<br />
In other news, the <A HREF="http://store.apple.com">new Apple Powerbook G4s</A> are out coming in 12", 15", and the new 17" models.
<br />
They are very sharp
<br />

<br />
Man I need sleep :)
<br />

<br />
I'm also buying some great DC stuff from <A HREF="http://groovemaster.livejournal.com">Groovemaster</A> including Samba De Amigo Maracas!!!
<br />
That would so get me to actually playing Samba 2001!
<br />

<br />
Well I'm outta here.
