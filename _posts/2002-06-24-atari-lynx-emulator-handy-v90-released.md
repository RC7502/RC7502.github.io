The <A HREF='http://www.esplexo.co.uk/'>emulator</A> for one of the most underrated handheld video game systems, the Atari Lynx, is now at v0.90.
<br />

<br />
Features of this version include:
<br />
<UL>
<br />
<LI>improved the image rendering
<br />
<LI>ZIP support has been added for all file types
<br />
<LI>there's a new snapshot format (old one still works) that doesn't contain the cartridge or boot ROM so you can now share those save games without fear.
<br />
<LI>A number of other less important bugs have been fixed, including one that would allow the window to be drawn off screen.
