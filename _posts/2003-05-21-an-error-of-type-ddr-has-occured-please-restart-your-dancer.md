<b>THIS IS A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM K-DOG</b>
<br />
I was rooting around DDRFreak and the wide world of Internet because of an episode of Fresh Gear I saw today on TechTV. Sumi Das, Host of the show, was at E3 trying out a NEW <A HREF="http://www.madcatz.com/MadCatz/press_releases.jsp?from=wn&row=4&id=78&showDetails=1">DDR Dance pad</a> from <A HREF="http://www.madcatz.com">MadCatz.</a>
<br />

<br />
Ultra Beat Padâ„¢ (PlayStation2, PlayStation1 and PlayStation)
<br />
New and improved beat pad with multiple lights designed specifically for your favorite dance games.
<br />

<br />
    * Acts as a fully featured digital controller
<br />
    * Works great with action and dancing games
<br />
    * Ten (10) high-performance action pads/buttons
<br />
    * Rubberized "no-slip" bottom
<br />
    * Flashing perimeter disco lighting
<br />
    * Thick, heavy-duty padding
<br />
    * 4-way directional control 
<br />

<br />
That just made me wonder even more, so I headed over to <A HREF="http://www.ddrfreak.com">DDRFreak</a> and found out something else specifically related to the new <A HREF="http://www.konamihwi.com/e3info/e3info.php">DDR Ultramix for Xbox.</a>
<br />

<br />
Apparently the Producer of the game has been posting on DDRfreak Forums and has cleared up a few things about the new Xbox release.
<br />

<br />
1) There will be player vs player over Xbox Live.
<br />
2) Batches of songs will be released every month for a Fee.
<br />
3) There will still be Free downloadable content.
<br />
4) The game has a November release date officially.
<br />
5) The October release date is for Dancing Stage Unleashed in Europe.
<br />
6) There is no planned PC version.
<br />
7) The game is being developed in Hawaii.
<br />
8) There will be no make your own DDR music mode.
<br />
9) There are 55 songs planned.
<br />
10) Ultramix will not be a Japanese release.
<br />
11) For online ranking they will have a way of determining if the user is playing with a controller or the actual dance pad.
<br />
<B>12) The thread also mentions that KCEJ has no plans for another DDR arcade mix to follow Extreme. :'(</b>
<br />

<br />
So far he has not answered questions regarding if Konami will be making pads for Xbox, or anything regarding DDRMAX2 American.
<br />

<br />
That's all for this special edition of my post!

K-dog out!!
