<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=296>Today's comic</a> is the final part of "things I thought about while I was bored on an airplane."
<br />

<br />
It's Friday the 13th... BOO!
<br />

<br />
Who decided Friday the 13th to be an unlucky day? Sure the number 13 is bad but why Friday? I'd be much more scared of a Monday the 13th, or a pissed off Wednesday the 25th. Oooooh I'm so scared of Friday, <scary voice>"You will be cursed with not having to work tomorrow, HA! HA! HA!"</scary voice> 
<br />

<br />
Uh oh, now I've probably pissed off Friday the 13th, but what's he going to do abou-- fnkashahlkjahlafnmajg;hejngrgsarrrrrgggghhhhh.....
