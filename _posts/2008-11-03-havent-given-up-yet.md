Sorry I haven't posted anything in awhile. I was kinda busy getting ready for and running my fifth marathon and then I wasn't motivated to do anything after that was over. Now I'd like to do a lot more with Bitsmack. I plan on blogging almost every day so that there is always new content when you visit. I may be changing the days I post new comics. Tuesday and Thursday are too close to each other. Also, I have started working on a new Bitsmack book. It's not going to be just a collection of old strips like other webcomics, I plan on it being mostly new, if not completely new content.

So what do you think? Is there anything else you'd like to see on Bitmsack? Are there any suggestions you can give me to make the site better?
