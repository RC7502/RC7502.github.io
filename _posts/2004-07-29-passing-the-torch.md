It has happened!  My little boy has (finally!) evolved from his infant stage where his amusements were rattles and plush novelty animals.  Over the weekend, we picked up <u>Barney's Hide and Seek</u> for the Sega Genesis, and, holy moley, does my little William love it!  "Play the Barney game, Daddy" is now his most frequently-uttered phrase.  Will now knows how to turn on the Genesis, and he knows to press the white button (aka the <b>Start</b> button) to begin playing.  When he gets tired of it, he turns off the TV and the Genesis all by himself.

At last!  Something good about being a parent.
