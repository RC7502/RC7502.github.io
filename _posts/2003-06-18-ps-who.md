Do you have a PS1 with LCD screen? Throw it out! According to <a href=http://www.lik-sang.com/news.php?artc=2963>this article</a> a Hong Kong company has produced a portable Dreamcast. It comes with an LCD screen, a remote for playing VCD/MP3, a car adapter, and a nifty carrying case. No word yet on where you can buy these, obviously Hong Kong is some kind lawless anarchy where copyrights have no meaning.
