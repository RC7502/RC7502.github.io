<b>Gamefly: One Month Later</b>
<br />
At the beginning of July I signed up for the Gamefly video game rental service. Here are my thoughts on it after one month.
<br />
<br />
For those of you not familar with Gamefly, it is an online service where I can have 2 video games out at a time for as long as I want for $22 a month. That may sound like a lot, but it may actually save you money in the long run. 
<br />
<br />
In the month of July I rented 6 games, 2 of them very new releases. Had I rented from Blockbuster it would have cost me $36, and that is assuming they had the titles in I wanted. (Gamefly allows you to add games to your list before they are released, what are the chances I would have got WarioWorld from Blockbuster the first weekend it was out?) That $36 also does not take into account the late fees I would have incured because I had some games out longer. If you rent more than 4 games a month, Gamefly is cheaper than Blockbuster.
<br />
<br />
However I'm also a game collector. Before Gamefly I very rarely rented games and instead would buy games when they hit the $20-$30 price range. Gamefly saved me at least $60-$70 on games that I seriously considered buying, but would have been tired of after a few days. I still buy games, but now I hold out for those few "must-haves" like KOTOR, The Wind Waker and Metroid Prime. 
<br />
<br />
I am certainly happy with the service but it does have its faults. Because they're located in CA, it's about 8-10 days from the time I send a game to the time I get the next one. Since I can have two games out at a time, I alternate so that I  always have one at my place and one in transit. 
<br />
<br />
I'll admit Gamefly isn't for everybody. However, if you rent more than 4 games a month or get tired of the games you buy too quickly I recommend checking it out. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030801.gif' alt'' />
