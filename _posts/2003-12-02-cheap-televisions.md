I went to Wal-mart this morning and was quite surprised. They had a 27 inch Symphonic TV for only $139. Several years ago you couldn't even buy a 13 inch for $139. And even better, the 27 inch TV is stereo.

I was surprised again when I saw a Symphonic DVD/VCR combo for only eighty bucks. If you want a TV at a great price. Go to wal-mart.
