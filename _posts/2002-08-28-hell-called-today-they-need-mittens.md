As you can tell by <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=46>today's comic,</a> hell has frozen over and I bought a Gamecube. Luckily I was able to get one used from Software Etc. along with my copy of Super Mario Sunshine. So far the game rocks. I'll put up my full review after I've played it some more. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20020828.gif' alt'' />
