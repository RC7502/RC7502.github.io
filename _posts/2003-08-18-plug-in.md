<b>Movie Review: Freddy vs. Jason</b>
<br />
Let me just start out this review by saying THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR. I realize Matrix Reloaded came out this year but it did not give me the enjoyment that Freddy vs. Jason did. Here are the top reasons I enjoyed the movie so much.
<br />

<br />
1. What happened to all the slasher movies? Honestly, I can think of a good slasher movie that's been released in the last 5 years. FvJ stayed true to the original formula of startling moments and ultraviolence. Even though the movie is really violent, it doesn't fall into the trap of becoming overly gross. I was more digusted by some of the scenes in Jackass than this movie. Watching this movie makes me want to go back and rent some of the old ones because they don't make them like this anymore.
<br />

<br />
2. It had a good storyline. Ok, slasher movies aren't known for their thought-provoking plots but FvJ came up with a plausible way for Freddy and Jason to fight each other. 
<br />

<br />
3. They fight each other! Fans of these old horror movies have been waiting for these two to duke it out for over a decade. Freddy and Jason get into a knockdown, dragout, no holds barred, use all your fighting cliches, battle that is better than I could have ever imagined. 
<br />

<br />
So there you have it. If you liked any Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th movie, you must see this movie. I'm not saying Freddy vs. Jason is the greatest movie ever. I'm saying that noone could make a movie called "Freddy vs. Jason" that was better than what I saw Friday night.
