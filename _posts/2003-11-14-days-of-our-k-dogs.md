Well my absence has been a rather large one but I have much to discuss.
<br />

<br />
DDR Ultramix for the Xbox is only days away finally! My purchase will include the Dance pad for the console so I can stack up the in house PS2 pad to the outsourced Xbox Konami pad.
<br />

<br />
The WSU DDR tourney was a HUGE success! I lost to Kel from Cincy in the second round but I managed to hold my own in the first song against him. Second song.... there were no survivors. Kim took home the gold in the light division and Lynex had some sandy competition. Congrats Kim :-D
<br />

<br />
Highlights:
<br />
-ToF had everyone moving to the sound of lousy DDR singers in Karaoke Revolution!
<br />
-Taiko no Tatsujin took main stage following the Karaoke Kompetition.
<br />
-Seeing more ppl watching Karaoke Rev over the DDR tourney was the funniest!
<br />
-Kevin Boddy and Kel doing TLoM facing backwards with mirror and stealth on Heavy and KevBo getting an "A"
<br />
-Stunna Steve, "C", V, BMR steps.
<br />

<br />
That's about all for now!
<br />
Stay tuned for more posts later.
<br />
Lates!
