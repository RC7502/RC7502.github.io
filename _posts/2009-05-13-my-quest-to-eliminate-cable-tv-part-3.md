In our <a href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2009/04/16/my-quest-to-eliminate-cable-tv-part-2/">last episode</a> I purchased an antenna and a converter box to watch TV over the air, but I would need an HD converter if I wanted to watch channels in high def. On Gozar's advice I bought a Voom box off of ebay for $20 including shipping. Apparently Voom was some kind of satellite company that went out of business but their boxes had an over the air option so you can use a Voom box as an HD tuner.

This gave me an excuse to buy a universal remote. The one I chose was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CCXCYC?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000CCXCYC">Logitech Harmony Xbox 360 Remote</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000CCXCYC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I've wanted a Harmony for a long time because of their easy setup capabilities, and I got the XBOX version because we watch all our movies through the 360. The remote connects to the computer through USB, then in the software you can set up your devices and customize all the buttons. It also has macro functions called "Abilities". I set up the abilities "watch TV", "play XBOX 360" and "play Wii". Then when you pick any of these activities it automatically turns on the device and switches the TV input number. I am pretty happy with the remote because now I can really just use one to control everything. The freakiest feature is that it can somehow sense when you are reaching for it and the buttons light up before you touch. I don't know how it does that but I only assume Logitech is involved in dark magic.

The Harmony works with the Voom box and I was able to scan the network stations. However, since the Voom was designed for satellite the menus are rather cumbersome when only using it for local channels. I also found a downside to the digital transition. Gozar had been telling me "it'll be great because there won't be static anymore, it'll either come in perfect or not at all." Well, that's not exactly true. While watching NBC it didn't have a good enough signal and the picture would freeze up and the sound would cut out. It's like watching a youtube video over a bad internet connection. I am hoping I can position my rabbit ears to get a better signal or else I might have to give up HD. Either way, after my vacation I think I'm definitely stopping cable.
