In this continuing series (at least until I get bored with it, or my copy of Guitar Hero III arrives in the mail) I discuss new trends that actually make life better (unlike most new trends that make me die a little inside, LINDSAY LOHAN). This week I would like to take a look at something that was invented by teenagers but is actually convenient, text messaging.

In the beginning Alexander Graham Bell, or A-Bell to his friends, invented the telephone and was considered a pretty cool guy until he got so big he was declared a monopoly and had to be broken into smaller Bells. Back in the 80s the telephone was limited to one per house. If you wanted to call someone they had to give you a 7 digit number that you would have to memorize or write on the wall next to the phone.  Everything was going great until someone said "hey I'm tired of going to the nearest building when I want to make a call, how do I talk to my friends when my car is upside down in a ditch?" 

The cell phone became popular in the 90s, first with stockbrokers, then with non-douchebags. Cell phones were handed out for free until every man, woman and infant in America had one. Now that everyone had one you could contact someone any time any where. However there are certain situations where you can't make a call at that moment, but you still want to tell your friend how awesome that party was last night. That's where text messaging comes into play. 

For old people, text messaging is like sending a telegram from your hand STOP. You can type a message on your cell phone then send it to someone else's cell phone. You don't have to talk to them at all! This works great for people you don't like talking to as well as situations where you can't talk to someone, such as a rock concert, meeting at work, or the birth of your second child. Messaging is more concise than a conversation. Instead of calling your partner up and hearing about their day you can just send them a message that says "bring home da corn chips." Everyone wins!

Cell phones were nice because it was easy to get a hold of people. But text messaging really made them great because it is the easiest, coldest, impersonal way to communicate. Thanks teenage youth culture!
