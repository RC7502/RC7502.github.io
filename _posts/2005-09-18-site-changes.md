As you can see I have switched over to Wordpress for Bitsmack.com. This is the first major site change in the 3 years Bitsmack has been up. One thing that is gone though is the game reviews section. I started Bitsmack because I could not find a single site that allowed users to write reviews for old video games. However now there are dozens of sites that do this, and do it much better than Bitsmack ever could. I know some people put a lot of work into posting reviews and I still have all of them. If you want a copy of your reviews send an email to <a href=mailto:reviews@bitsmack.com>reviews@bitsmack.com.</a> Also, the podcast feed url has changed and you will have to update your podcast program with the link up on the "podcast rss" button. 

So why did I switch to wordpress? Many reasons. When you first bring up the old site there is just too much crap everywhere. I wanted a simpler site that just has blog, comics, podcast and forums. Since all the comics are contained in their own post you can now write comments on any comic. You don't even have to register or login! Wordpress is many times easier to post to and I didn't have to write hardly any custom code to get it to work (unlike Postnuke). I still do have some work to do. I have about 100 comics in the archives that didn't get converted over right so I still need to fix. 

So what do you guys think? Do you like the new site or the old site better?
