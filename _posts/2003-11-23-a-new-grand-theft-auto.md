I have great news. I just learned that a new Grand Theft Auto game is being made. It's going to be released some time in 2004. When it's first released, it will most likely only be made for the Playstation 2.
<br />
Many people will flock to stores to buy the new GTA game. I'll be one of them. GTA 3 and GTA Vice City were two of the best video games ever made. The Electronic Boutique stores alone sold 100,000 copies of GTA Vice City on the day it was released.
<br />
I can't wait to get the new GTA. If you own a PS2, get this new GTA game. Get GTA 3 and Vice City also. You can get them both together for $40.00.
