I really don't know what Link was like in <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=113>college.</a> I also don't know his feelings on Valentine's Day. I just assume he agrees with me.

Our poll is still going strong. I haven't voted myself because I don't want to affect the results. The poll is going to keep going until next Sunday so be sure to get your votes in!

I'm currently working on two projects in addition to Bitsmack. One of them is the Bitsmackers cartoon. The other one is a game, but I don't want to give too much away right now. Needless to say, I'm keeping busy in my free time.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030212.gif' alt'' />
