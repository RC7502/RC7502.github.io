I got my 1K on <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ironman/index.html?tag=result;title;3">Iron Man</a> last night.  The most frustrating part was I was stuck on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/game/936559.html">level 7</a> on the hardest difficulty for a few hours.  It was disappointing as I could have been gaining achievements in any other game but no, I wanted the <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/code/936559.html">last 150 GS</a> from beating on formidable (the hardest difficulty).  I found that the classic red/yellow suit and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor">hulkbuster</a> were the best for a variety of different levels.  When you play easy the game just lets you walk over it.  No looking before you leap just simply run and gun.  The game reminded me much of <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/n64/strategy/blastcorps/index.html?tag=result;title;0">Blast Corps</a> for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64">N64</a> (don't get me wrong NOTHING can compare to that game it was simply AMAZING!) except with unlimited bullets and missiles as I just pretty much blew up anything that moved in each level and when they said "you weren't supposed to kill those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian">civilians</a>" I just replayed the level and blasted everything but them!<br /><br />I've got to hand it to the game.  It made me hate it [and <a href="http://www.sega.com/">Sega</a>].  I was reminded of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=monkey%20ball&ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">Monkey Ball</a> style missions where if you make the wrong move it laughed and said "Haha you're dead start all over loser!" I have to give props to <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/worldseriesofpoker2008battleforthebracelets/index.html?tag=result;title;3">World Series of Poker 2008</a> for keeping me sane while I tried to beat the stupid artic level as right before I'd want to throw my controller at the screen I'd stick that game in for awhile and continue my "Battle for the bracelets" as the game touts.<br /><br />So what's it all mean?  I think I would give <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/ironman?q=iron%20man">Iron Man</a> a 7.5 out of 10 for what it was worth.  The main game on Easy is awesome!  It's a very arcadey style of gameplay that I enjoyed last time from <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/stateofemergency/index.html?tag=result;title;1">State of Emergency</a>.  There were a few flaws like missing a grab for a missile results in a rocket to the face which on Formidible you can take about 3 of those on average from all the suits.  The game is well designed and functions properly unless you're trying to walk without firing where the game has <a href="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/">Iron Man</a> constantly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonwalk_%28dance%29">moonwalking</a> around the screen as the rockets pulverise you.  No lock on system prior to firing your weapon was a bit of a pain but overall I enjoyed he game... unlike <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/kingkong?q=king%20kong">King Kong</a>.<br /><br />So last night I was thinking about the fact that I needed another game to relax me from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man">Iron Man</a>.  Then I started thinking that I'm not really just playing one game at any given time for achievements.  This past weekend I played <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/rockband/index.html?tag=result;title;0">rock band</a> with Seal and Chase, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/guitarheroiii/index.html?tag=result;title;1">Guitar Hero</a> with Mike about 2 weeks ago, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/adventure/legoindianajones/index.html?tag=result;title;1">Lego Indy </a>with Kim, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/armyoftwo/index.html?tag=result;title;0">Army of Two</a> with Trimmer and <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/worldseriesofpoker2008?q=world%20series%20of%20poker%202008">WSOP 2008</a> when I couldn't take any more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhgzIM-9lfA">Iron Man</a>.<br /><br />I guess it breaks down to this:<br />1K goal: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/shrek3/index.html?tag=result;title;4">Shrek the 3rd</a><br />Long Term: <a href="http://www.activision.com/">WSOP 2008</a><br />Co-op: <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/legoindianajonestheoriginaladventures?q=lego%20indiana%20jones">Lego Indy</a><br />For fun: <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/soulcaliburiv/index.html?tag=result;title;0">Soul Calibur 4</a> (yea it comes out today and I'm actually excited.)<br />
