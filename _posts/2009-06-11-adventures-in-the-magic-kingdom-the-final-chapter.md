On Friday and Saturday we went back to Magic Kingdom and Epcot to do the things that we missed. At Magic Kingdom Ashley and I re-enacted the proposal since we didn't get any pictures of it the first time. Here are the other things we did:

<!--more-->

<strong>Magic Kingdom</strong>

<strong>Big Mountain Railroad</strong>
I couldn't get Ashley to ride this one, and I was a little nervous myself since I don't normally like roller coasters. This one is really tame though. I loved it!

<strong>Astro Orbiter</strong>
This one is like the Dumbo ride only higher up and more awesome. I couldn't get Ashley to ride this one either.

<strong>Magic Carpet Ride</strong>
Just like Dumbo and Astro Oribter, unfortunately they didn't play any Steppenwolf. 

<strong>Winnie The Pooh's Ride</strong>
This is just like Peter Pan and Snow White's rides. A good one for little kids.

<strong>Character Buffet</strong>
If you've ever wanted to eat dinner while being groped by the Pooh gang, now's your chance! Actually it was pretty fun. The food was good and different characters would come over to your table for pictures.

<strong>Epcot</strong>

<strong>The Lion King Environment Movie</strong>
Timon, Pumba and Simba make you feel bad about destroying the environment. It was worth it though to hear Pumba say "DAAAAAMN" when showing a picture of the Hoover Dam.

<strong>The Seas with Nemo</strong>
This was pretty boring, I don't know what they were trying to accomplish. You just see multiple characters from Finding Nemo asking where Nemo is.

<strong>Hanging Out With Crush</strong>
This was the funniest thing we saw the whole trip. They had a room with kids on the floor and adults in the back. There was a screen with Crush from Finding Nemo and he would ask questions and talk to the kids and parents. The guy doing the voice was really funny and must be good at improv. I almost didn't want to do this because I thought it was just for little kids but it was pretty hilarious.

<strong>Soarin</strong>
I was proud that Ashley did this one even though she's afraid of heights. Basically you sit in a chair and they raise you up in front of an Imax screen. The chair sways back and forth as you soar over mountains and different scenic locations. It was pretty fun. After it was over one of the employees offered to let us ride again without getting in line but Ashley didn't want to.

<strong>Journey Into Imagination</strong>
When I was like five I remember thinking this ride was awesome. Either I am remembering it wrong or they drastically changed it because it was pretty crappy. 

<strong>Canada Movie with Martin Short</strong>
Martin Short narrates this movie about different areas of Canada. The theater has a 360 degree screen which is pretty cool.

<strong>The Beers of the World Challenge</strong>
There are 11 countries at Epcot and they're open from I think 11am-10pm. The challenge was to drink 1 beer in each country. I didn't get started till about noon so I had less than an hour for each one. I was able to get through 8 of the 11 countries, then we had dinner at the British restaurant. That's when I felt sick and was ready to go back to the room. I was ok with what I did accomplish and it gives me something to work for on my next trip to Epcot. Unfortunately, I was really sick the next day and that was when we were flying back to Ohio.

So that is the end of our Disney Adventure. The best part was getting engaged to someone who doesn't care that I am a total geek. I think you can have a lot of fun at Disney World even without kids. I hope to go back again in a few years.
