I got the idea for today's <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=340>comic</a> when I was out at Video Games Express on the north side of Columbus. My goal is to eventually hit every video game store in the Columbus area. Anyway, I have nothing against people who want to collect Hot-Wheels or anything else for that matter.

In other news, I hope to get the tshirts ordered this week before I leave for New Orleans on Thursday. I think it will be a good time even though it is a work related Microsoft convention.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20031006.gif' alt'' />
