I've played <A HREF="http://www.dothack.com">.hack </a>for roughly 18 hours now and I can't stop! Everywhere I go I think of the game. Essentially this game is based on you being a character who plays an MMORPG in the game. So you're playing a game that's about a game.
<br />

<br />
It all started when your friend invited you to play the game "The World" from a ficticious group known as the Cyber Connect Corp. which is the in this the highest selling game game grossing over 20 million copies worldwide in this imaginary world. You meet your friend in "The World and as he's showing you around and teaching you how to play, something goes wrong. You see a ghost like figurine give your friend a book and then is killed by a big monster thing. You get transported out of the game and call your friend to see what happened. He never answers his phone and 3 days later you find out he's in a coma. So you think it has something to do with the game and you continue to play and meet new people to try and figure out what happened to your friend.
<br />

<br />
Trust me, it's IMMENSLY ADDICTING. It does what the battle system of Kingdom Hearts couldn't do. Your secondary characters are almost completly controllable by telling them what to do. The hardest part is keeping their weapons and armor up to date. It plays much like every other MMORPG with more of an action base on the battle system and finally the story line is much like an FF game.
<br />

<br />
And to think that the only reason I bought the game was b/c of the hype in Japan and the fact that Software etc only had 2 copies left out of the 30 or so they got in on Tuesday. 
<br />

Well I'll see you all at the Defiance Tourney this Saturday!
