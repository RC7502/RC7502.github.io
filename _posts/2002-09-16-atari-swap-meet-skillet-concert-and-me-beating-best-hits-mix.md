The weekend began like any other. I, Kruton6, lying on the couch surfing the web and watching TechTV until I get invited to goto the Drive-in in Kenton and see Signs and XXX. Signs had me entertained and quiet for the last 30 mins. XXX was awesome!!! Stuff blew up and I never knew Vin Deisel was humorous in any way!!
<br />

<br />
The next morn. I woke up late to go with RC and Goz to Columbus to the Atari swap meet and we met a man who was as excited about a game called Mountian King as I am about DDR!!! Needless to say the best part of the day was finding a new video game store across from Microcenter. We also decided to attend and display our business and promote BiTsMaCk at the <A HREF="http://www.cinciclassic.com">CinciClassic</A> which is a 2 day event at the Forest Fair mall in Cincinnati. Admission is free and anyone planning to attend should go vote for DDRMAX to be a tourney there.
<br />

<br />
Lastly I completed DDR Best Hits for PSX by beating every song on Maniac and double maniac.
<br />

<br />
I also went to an awesome Skillet concert on Sunday with the youth group, RC, and my friends from Findlay. I had a pretty full weekend and it never seems to slow down. :-/

K-dog out!
