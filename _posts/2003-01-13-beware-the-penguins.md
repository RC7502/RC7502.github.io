<b>DVD Review: Insomnia (R)</b>
<br />
I wanted to see this movie because it was directed by Christopher Nolan, who also directed Memento (one of my favorite films ever). Insomnia is the story of an L.A. detective, played by Al Pacino, who goes to Alaska to investigate a murder. The sun is always up and he doesn't get any sleep for days. This wasn't the typical crime drama I was expecting. There were a couple of twists and turns that kept it interesting. It wasn't as fast paced and psychological as Memento but it was still an ok movie. 
<br />
<br />
The special features inlcude a couple behind the scenes documentaries and a director's commentary. On my DVD scale of Buy it, Rent it, Avoid it, I'd say if you are a Memento fan or really like crime dramas rent it, otherwise you might want to avoid it because there are a lot of better movies out there.

<b>Afterthoughts:</b>
<br />
I posted my review of <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=8719>Beach Spikers</a> today but then I made another observation. When playing World Mode, in the middle of each match you get a couple of chances to give feedback to your partner. You can choose praise, encourage, reprimand, or nothing. This will increase or decrease your teamwork rating. However, sometimes praise or encouragment just pisses off your partner and decreases your rating. At first I thought that was strange but then I realized the characters are women. Sega has somehow perfectly simulated the female mind! It doesn't matter what you say because in the end their response is going to be completely random. Sega scores one point for realism.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030113.gif' alt'' />
