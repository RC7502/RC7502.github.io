Since Harrison has been born, my weight has risen steadily. Right here is where I would put a chart showing a line representing weight going up over time. I'm pretty lazy so just imagine it in your head. I've tried to lose weight counting calories but counting them didn't stop me from overeating. I also got back into running and ran a half marathon but my weight stayed the same. 

So a year ago I watched the movie Fat Sick and Nearly Dead on Netflix. This guy Joe who was obese and had skin problems drank nothing but fresh fruit/vegetable juice for 60 days, lost a lot of weight and no longer needed medication. I find it hard to call it a documentary because it seemed more like an infomercial for this Joe's weight loss site: <a href="http://rebootwithjoe.com">rebootwithjoe.com.</a> Anyway, I've been hearing about a lot of people trying these juice cleanses so I thought I would give it a shot. Worst case scenario I spent $50 on a juicer drank healthy stuff. 

I'm going to try this juice reboot for the next 5 days and be strict with it. I'll blog about my experience here every day along with how much I spent. 

The juicer I bought was this:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E0IBKLQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00E0IBKLQ&linkCode=as2&tag=bitsmack-20">Hamilton Beach 67601A Big Mouth Juice Extractor, Black</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00E0IBKLQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> $49.99

I went to the store to buy supplies today:
2 20oz thermal mugs (for taking juice to work), $11.97
4 cucumbers, $2.76
1 kale bunch, $1.49
1 bag of carrots, $1.79
1 gingeroot, $1.97
1 bag of celery, $1.50
1 bag of lemons, $3.49
1 bag of apples, $3.99

Total on produce: $16.99, (about the same as 3 lunches in the work cafeteria)

I tried out the juicer tonight. First I made Joe's Mean Green juice. This is the recipe Joe drinks most in the movie. It contains kale, cucumber, celery, apple, lemon and gingeroot. Starting up the juicer the first time scared Harrison. It is loud. I added ice cubes to the juice to increase the volume and I like it better cold. The taste was ok, not terrible. Definitely the cucumber is the overwhelming flavor. I saved the rest for tomorrow's lunch. I made another recipe that's just carrots, apples and a lemon and saved that for tomorrow's breakfast. 

Other than the juice the only other things I can have are water, coconut water and herbal decaf tea. Supposedly this plan is not only good for losing weight but also getting more energy and clearer skin. I'll give it a shot for 5 days and see what the results are.
