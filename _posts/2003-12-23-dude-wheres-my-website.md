For some reason the site was down yesterday. So here is a special <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=369>Tuesday comic!</a>
<br />
<br />
So last weekend was pretty eventful. There was the Devryguyz Christmas party, then we saw LOTR Saturday, then my family Christmas Sunday. I got a couple of DVDs and a waffle maker. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Cool site of the day</b>
<br />
I also found a cool site called <a href=http://www.guzzlefish.com>Guzzlefish.</a> This site lets you enter in all your DVDs, Games and CDs, then you get a approximate value for your collection. It's pretty fun. You can see my collection <a href=http://www.guzzlefish.com/collection.php?username=chill182>here.</a><br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20031223.gif' alt'' />
