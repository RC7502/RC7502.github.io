After my initial freakout yesterday I found a folder on my computer where I worked on a cartoon for awhile. I gave up because I couldn't get animation done in an hour and I have a short attention span. It had a few characters, some backgrounds and a lot of props so I have enough to keep the comic going. The funny thing is some weeks I don't feel like doing a comic, but then as soon as I thought I couldn't do one I just wanted to do it even more. I've already got a couple ideas so expect some more comics soon!
