Though I'm not a fierce, lunatic gamer like some of those who frequent this site, I do like to play video games, and have been part of the scene since I got my Atari 2600 in 1980.
<br />

<br />
So, I'm not an expert in video games, but I like to think I'm not a complete ignoramus.  Turns out that maybe I am.
<br />

<br />
To wit: I though that the 2-D side-scrolling platform-jumping video game was dead.  Perhaps it <i>is</i> dead, but its death was much more recent than I had previously thought.
<br />

<br />
Over the weekend I added a new title to my Game Boy collection: <b>Wario Land 3</b>.  It is a 2-D side-scrolling platform-jumping game, which was published in 2000, and, holy-moley it is totally bitchin'.  I love the graphics; I love the little musical ditties; I love the little bite-sized levels (unlike the gigantic monstrosities in, for example, <b>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</b>); and I love the different afflictions thar beplague Wario: eating doughnuts and becoming fat, turning into a zombie, becoming entangled in a ball of silkwork silk, etc.  Another classic Nintendo acid trip.
<br />

<br />
I had no idea that there were such games so recently.  I've really missed out.
