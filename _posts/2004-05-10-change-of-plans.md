I've decided to make a change at Bitsmack. Instead of doing comics Monday, Wednesday and Friday I'm going to switch to Tuesday and Thursday. It's really hard to get a comic done on Sunday and I came to the conclusion that I'd rather get two good comics done a week than two good ones and one below average. So stop back tomorrow for a brand new comic!
