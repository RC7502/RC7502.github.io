Hi all, sorry I have been absent as of late. I've been doing a lot of school work as well as trying to secure a DDR machine for purchase. I did have a DDR tourney this past weekend in Columbus. I ended up getting 1st in Lower Heavy so I guess I'm moving up to Upper Heavy from here on out. NW Ohio had a rather large group attending including Kim, Lynex, Hogan, and Kornkid Chris. We ended up taking a LOT of places for the first time! Kim got 2nd in Standard with Lynex coming up 3rd, and kornkid chris attends his first *REAL* tourney and ends up getting 2nd to me after a tight 3 songs. I now have to goto my next klazz.

K-dog out!!
