A lot more has happened to us than just <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=75>today's comic.</a> Sometimes I have a lot of good ideas for comics. Other days are like today. That's why I'm starting a new contest. It's called the "so you think you can do better" comic contest. All through the month of November I am accepting submissions for comics. You can use my characters or use your own characters. The only restriction is that the comics must be funny. Send your comic to <a href=mailto:comics@bitsmack.com>comics@bitsmack.com</a>
<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021104.gif'   />
