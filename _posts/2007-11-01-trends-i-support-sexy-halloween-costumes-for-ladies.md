I know I haven't posted a comic in at least a fortnight but I have been having writers block lately. Not that I haven't had ANY ideas, just that they've been longer commentaries that don't easily lend themselves to the four panel format. One of those ideas I will call "Trends I Support".

The older you get the easier it is to criticize how America's youth culture is unimaginative and has been on the decline in the areas of film, TV, video games and music since the late 1980s. I could write an article every day where I pick something popular and talk about how lame it is. However, I am a lazy, lazy man. Instead I am going to pick those few new trends that are actually good ideas. The current pop culture is not 100% bad so I would like to highlight those that aren't.

The first trend that I fully support is sexy Halloween costumes for ladies. Without doing any research at all, it seems to me ladies have been dressing more foxily in the last 3 to 4 years. I remember vividly seeing a woman in a sexy costume and thinking "you are going outside, dressed like that, and it's not against your will at all?". It was great because now there was a good reason to go to costume parties, of which there were no good reasons to attend prior to that. 

The formula is a simple one. Take any regular costume, add the word "sexy" to the front and then expose as much skin as you want or, in the case of girls with low inhibitions, expose as much skin as the law will allow. Mission accomplished!

I should warn you though, not every sexy costume is Good Times USA. There are restrictions to what is considered awesome. First of all if you are under 18 you should not be wearing sexy costumes. Until you are an adult stick to the same Rainbow Brite and Strawberry Shortcake costumes you've been wearing since you were a kid. Second, the sexy costume only works if you have a moderate amount of sexiness to begin with. I understand that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but if the party you go to has people covering their eyes in disgust you might have been better off cutting two eye holes in a sheet.

To be fair and balanced I suppose I should take a second to talk about sexy costumes for guys. However, I don't think anyone male or female wants to see that. Picture in your head a guys Batman costume but with a bare midriff and short shorts. Now kill yourself.

That's it for this issue of Trends I Support. What do you guys think? Post in the comments below.
