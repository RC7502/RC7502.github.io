Previously on Heroes, the bad guys were on one side, the good guys on the other, and Hiro was acting like a 10 year old in a comic book store. By the way, HOW IN THE HELL is Mr. Isaac drawing The 9th Wonders comic FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE? Marvel should really hire this guy. He is never late on an issue even more than a year after his death.

<strong>Part 1</strong>

Hiro and Ando meet up with Speedster and Parkman. Speedster freaks out and takes off. The three musketeers teleport after her to Kansas. This is Speedster's horrific past they've been hinting about all these weeks? Living in Kansas? (shutters) The eclipse comes, Parkman and Hiro lose their powers. Parkman whines so Hiro throws corn at him until he stops. This corn throwing will become my favorite level if they ever make a Heroes video game. Hiro and Ando go to the comic book store and meet Seth Green and Breckin Meyer. I don't know what "Red Hulk" is but I will definitely be looking into it. Parkman finally gets to talk to Speedster but she comes out using crutches and I feel like a jerk for what I said before.

Nathan and Peter literally take off to find the Hatian. Nathan loses his flying abilities, WHEEEEE!!!! SPLOOSH! They find the Hatian and his friend who's skin in impenetrable and he has his own army. Peter looks up at the eclipse and its still not over. This is the longest eclipse in the history of the universe.

Suresh is still all scaly though now they kinda look like pickles on his arm. Maybe the Burger King could cure his disease. During the eclipse he stumbles out of his cocoon like he was throwing a keg party in there and surprise, he's cured of picklenoma. He tries to leave but Papa Petrelli won't let him.

Claire gets fight lessons from Noah. If only we had an 80s fight training montage this would go much quicker. Noah's all like "I want you to hit me as hard as you can." Elle and Sylar show up but the eclipse took away their powers too. HILARITY ENSUES! Also ensuing is the beatdown Noah is giving Sylar. I've wanted Sylar to get his ass kicked since first season. Claire gets shot and Noah is like "well good luck with that, goodbye." Meanwhile Elle is all bummed about not having powers (the same powers she wanted to get rid of a couple of weeks ago). She's all "what are we going to do now" and Sylar replies "let's bone." Noah is outside with a sniper rifle hoping to make this the most disgusting makeout session ever.

TO BE CONTINUED... RIGHT NOW

<strong>Part 2</strong>

Previously on Heroes, it turns out impenetrable dude is the brother of the Hatian. I missed that before.

Claire gets rushed to the hospital and the doctor is all snipy about how she got shot. Uh, why don't you save her first and be a bitch later on? Later, Claire is like "why did I complain about not feeling pain before, pain sucks hard!".

Noah is the worst sniper in the world when he can't hit two post-coitus naked people lying on the floor. He kicks in the door and I suddenly realize that when no one on this show has powers, Noah is by far the most badass. Sylar and Elle get away but not before Elle quite literally takes a cap in her ass. Noah yells out "are you not entertained!" What seems like days have passed and the eclipse is still going on. The Earth has stopped revolving and all life ceases to exist. The end.

Sylar tries to patch Elle up at the most inconsiderate pharmacy in the world. Seriously, people just walk by not giving a crap that someone is laying in the aisle bleeding. Sylar is like "if Noah is following your blood trail maybe we should split up, you know, for YOUR safety." Elle is all "RC is right, without our powers Noah is the most badass on this show." They go to the box factory where Bart's class is having a field trip and Noah and Sylar start punch-fighting. Noah ends it by sliting Sylar's throat.

Nathan wakes up in the dungeon from Aladdin. The Hatian's brother may not have powers but he has an army, and prostitutes (but not an army OF prostitutes like Norm Macdonald had in Dirty Work). Just before the Hatian's brother (if he becomes a regular I'll think up a better nickname, something like Impenatro) is about to get some The Hatian and Peter melee him in what would have been an instant kill in Halo 3. They get to Nathan's cell and are like "we're bustin out!".

Suresh wants to booty call his old girlfriend Maya but Papa Petrelli wants his powers back. Suresh spouts some nonsense about the eclipse and mentally challenged Pyro is like "blah blah blah" which is actually the smartest thing he's ever said. Suresh escapes by hitting Pyro repeatedly with a microscope which is I think the most scientisty thing I've ever seen.

Parkman and Speedster talk about how they don't have powers and we all have a pity party for Speedster.

Hiro and Ando buy all the back issues of 9th Wonders so Hiro can figure out what has happened up until now. Apparently buying Heroes Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD would take too long. Parkman shows up in the comic store surprised to see them even though he somehow knew to look for them in a comic store. Breckin puts 2 and 2 together about the first eclipse giving powers and the current eclipse (which has been going on for weeks) taking them away. After reading the crazy stuff that happens Hiro decides he doesn't want to grow up he wants to be a Toys R Us kid.

A year later the eclipse finally ends

Speedster makes things right with her dad.

Peter gets into a gunfight and knows how to shoot an assault rifle somehow. Apparently the special effects budget was saved for the second half of the episode because Nathan flies and slams Impentro into a truck crushing it (if it was only his skin that was impentrable how were his organs and bones not crushed by that?). The Hatian realizes its time to take down his brother once and for all so he kills his brother USING ONLY HIS MIND.

Suresh shows up for his booty call but his scales come back, and like a pimple on prom night his date is ruined.

Seth Green gives Hiro a speech about growing up. Seth is holding out for a hero til the end of the night. He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta be fresh from the fight. The geeks <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">blindly guess</span> figure out that Hiro has to take Claire back in time to the famous rooftop to get his memory back. (They do point out that Hiro and Claire have never met which I had never noticed before. Boy this show has a lot of characters.)

Noah gets home and talks to Claire and is like "your powers are back? OMG Sylar!". Who then shows up with Elle, both fully powered. Sylar force chokes Noah saying "I find your lack of faith disturbing". Noah is like "Arthur is not your father, search your feelings you know its true." Claire screams "NOOOOOOO". And RC's computer explodes from making too many Star Wars references.

COOLEST MOMENT OF THE EPISODE: Hiro blinks in, teleports out Sylar, blinks back in, teleports out Elle, blinks back in, says "Save the Cheerleader", and teleports out with Claire. Noah and his wife stand there stunned that they just witnessed the coolest thing ever. RC rewinds to watch again.

The comic nerds combat my claims from earlier in this post and say that they JUST NOW read the last issue of 9th Wonders Mr. Issac drew before he died. But he gave his sketchbook of the real last story to a bike messenger. I think I remember that happening.

Nathan and Peter talk in the jungle. Nathan thinks giving people powers is a good idea giving some reasoning that doesn't make sense at all. He takes off leaving Peter to find his own way home.

Suresh, looking scaly and gross, goes back to work for Arthur.

Sylar and Elle were teleported to a beach. Sylar is like "I know you are still bleeding from being shot, but wanna make out?" Elle is all "you're getting sand in my wound and ow, well ok". Then he kills Elle.

Hiro and Claire arrive on the rooftop. Claire sees Sulu give her as a baby to Noah and is like "holy ..."
