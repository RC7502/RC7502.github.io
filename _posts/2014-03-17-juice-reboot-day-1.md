My starting weight for this experiment is 178. I'm not going to weigh myself again until Saturday morning because I don't want to risk getting discouraged if my weight doesn't go down. I got up early and walked 1.4 miles on the treadmill. If the temperature gets warmer I'll run outside this week. I don't like running on the treadmill. I would rather walk and do stuff on my laptop. I drank my carrot-apple-lemon juice I made last night and it tasted mostly like lemons. It wasn't bad but next time I might peal the lemon first. After adding ice cubes I had about 16oz of juice and it was pretty filling. I feel about as full as I would eating my usual bagel or pop tarts.

Usually when I get to work I have to have a cup of coffee before I do anything. Today I substituted my coffee for hot decaf tea. I've never had hot tea before but I ended up liking it quite a bit. After that I drank just regular water until lunch time. My stomach was growling by then. I had the mean green juice for lunch and then my one cheat was a stick of gum afterward. On the reboot FAQ they say you can have unsweetened natural gum but I didn't have any of that so I chewed a piece I already had in my desk. 

I was surprised that by afternoon I was already getting a headache from caffeine withdrawal. I thought it would take at least a day for that to happen. I took one ibuprofen and drank another cup of hot tea. My stomach felt full but I was craving foods. 

For dinner I had carrot/apple/gingeroot juice. I discovered that I don't think I like gingeroot. I'm going to try using less of it in the future. To make things easy I made dinner, breakfast and tomorrow's lunch at once. 

1 day down, 4 to go.
