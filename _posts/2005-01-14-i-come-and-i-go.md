New Years: cbus party!!<br />
<br />
New Life, new semester, new style:<br />
Last semester, gotta get the resume together and get sending.  I've got 9-5 days now M-F.  I get an occasional 11-1 break M-W-F.  Got some stuff to sell on Ebay this month.<br />
K-dog's Arcade Distribution Service (KADS) is official.  I put in a request for a business credit card :)  Hopefully I get approval.<br />
I want to get one more machine and fix my beatmania before I graduate.<br />
<br />
No telling what's to happen with me.  Maybe when I have a fixed life I'll be more active here, but for now I'm running in a lot of different forums.<br />
<br />
K-dog out!
