Between the MAME cabinet (more on that later) and Zelda: Four Swords, I didn't get a comic done last night. I have to say though Four Swords is one of the best multiplayer games I've played on the Gamecube and definately the best one that uses the GBA. 
<br />

<br />
Basically the concept of Four Swords is that four people have to work together as a team to defeat enemies and figure out puzzles while at the same time each person is trying to grab the most gems. When you play with less than four people someone has to control two characters as once. This isn't very hard to do. At the end of each level a winner is declared based on enemies killed, gems, deaths, etc, but then you lose all your items and powerups and start the next level. At first I thought this was lame but then I realized this makes it a better party game because it's not like you have <i>your</i> character. After a level you could swap people in and out and not have to worry about creating new characters or some people getting much stronger than others.

The graphics are a little better than I expected. It pretty much looks like Link to the Past for the GBA with a few special effects from Wind Waker. The music I was a somewhat disappointed with. Using the Zelda theme once in a game is nostaligic, filling the game with only music from previous Zeldas is just lazy. It would have been nice to have some new music. 
<br />

<br />
All in all if you already have GBAs and link cables Four Swords is a pretty good multiplayer experience.
