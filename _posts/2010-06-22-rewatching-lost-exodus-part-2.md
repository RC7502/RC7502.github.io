We open on Turniphead's eye. Charlie wants a gun to protect Claire and the baby and possibly maintain his perfect 100% shot/kill ratio. 

On the island: Getting dynamite for the hatch, sailing and Claire's baby gets kidnapped by Danielle.
Off the island: More scenes of all the characters before they get on the flight. 

The Hatch Gang check out the Black Rock and its cool that it looks mostly as the same as it did in the final season of Lost. Locke thinks the ship came from the west coast of Africa and I'm like "boy you're way off". So at this point are the candidates protected by Jacob? Is that why they didn't Artz themselves when moving the dynamite? 

Continuity error: Walt is playing a Game Boy Advance SP and even though he's not playing Activision Anthology it's making noises like an Atari 2600. Later, he tells Michael he needs batteries, but the SP has a built in rechargeable battery. 

Ashley's note: she wasn't really impressed, not a lot happens in this episode.
