Well the <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=47>first week of classes</a> was as lame as can be expected. My classes are cake. I don't even think I'll have to write a single report this semester since I am taking all Tech and Math classes. 
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty excited about DDR coming back to Findlay. I went out to the mall at lunch but it wasn't there yet. I played Soul Cailbur 2 instead. It's pretty cool but the graphics aren't any better than the first one on <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=system&system=Dreamcast>Dreamcast.</a> Once I get off work I am heading back out. 
<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention I have been playing <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=8710>Super Mario Sunshine</a> every free moment I've had this week. You can read my full review <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=8710>here.</a><br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20020830.gif' alt'' />
