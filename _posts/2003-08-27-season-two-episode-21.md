Yesterday I bought the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=324>Simpsons Season 3 DVD.</a> I've been looking forward to this one because season three has my most favorite episodes.

<img src=images/news/20030827.jpg align=left>In other DVD news, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Special Ripoff Edition was released yesterday. Just like with the first Lord of the Rings movie they plan on releasing 46 different versions where each release is more specialer than the one before. If you hold out on buying this movie, eventually a version will come out with a deleted scene where Gandolf and Anakin Skywalker have a lightsaber duel on the bridge of the Enterprise. It's ultimately a lose/lose situation because the second you buy this version they'll release the one with the zombie Tolkien audio commentary. You may not be able to win, but if you're a fan at all you should at least wait until the next edition.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030827.gif' alt'' />
