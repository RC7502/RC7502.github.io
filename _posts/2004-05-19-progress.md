I installed Windows 2000 and that fixed all of my sound card and game pad issues. I spent last night getting an NES emulator running. I had tried FCE Ultra last week but was not impressed with its performance. This time I tried RockNESX. It performed really well but when you hit ESC it wouldn't exit like a regular emulator, instead it brought up the GUI. Because of this it was unusable with Game Launcher. I then tried VirtuaNES. It runs really well and has tons of configuration options. I had to hack the ini file to make the ESC key work. It does do one annoying thing where is shows the mouse pointer in the middle of the screen. After reading some forums I may have to write a program that moves the mouse up into the corner when VirtuaNES is launched.

I got the mp3 feature to work with Game Launcher and it really adds to the experience. When you quit a game it goes right back to the place it was playing in the mp3. Goz sent me some 80s tunes and I used Winamp to create a playlist text file. So right now I have MAME and NES running. The next step is going to be to add SNES and Atari 800. I want to play Bruce Lee, but Brad thinks it would be cool to play Chrono Trigger on an arcade cabinet.
