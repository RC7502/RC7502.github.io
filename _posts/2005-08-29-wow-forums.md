Hello WoWers!<br />
The Bitsmack guild is up and running with a current count of 14 players.  The forums are up, go register and let me know if you are an officer so I can slap the right tag on you within the forums and lets get this guild rolling!<br />
<br />
We're going to run an open enrollment soon so if anyone has friends that have dying guilds bring them on here!  We're going to be moving into the leveling stages of the guild as soon as I get internet at my new apartment!<br />
<br />
So once again, welcome, enjoy your stay, and have a great time here at Bitsmack!<br />
<br />
K-dog out
