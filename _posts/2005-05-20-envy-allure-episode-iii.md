Howdy Bitsmackers!<br /><br />
Episode III lived up to the hype. This past thursday morning we traveled from Findlay to the great capitol of Columbus.  <br /><br />
<br /><br />
Lately life's been busy trying to mount in WoW, podcasting with the crew and working for a living.  I envy RC because I think I sit through a LOT more meetings than he does and hours are varing.  I picked up a few new games plus a nintendo DS along the way and have gotten into multiplayer games of the week at the Findlay house.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Looks like the smaller but always great K-dog's bday bash will be held in Kenton this weekend.  If you're in town or around come on out and party with us.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Other than that call us at (206)222-BITS!<br /><br />
<br /><br />
K-dog out!
