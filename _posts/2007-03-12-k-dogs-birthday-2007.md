I decided to play around with Comic Life since it came with my new computer AND they have an Intel Mac version unlike my previous favorite comic drawing program (I'm looking your direction formerly Macromedia but now Adobe Flash). So far I think Comic Life is pretty cool when using photos. I think I might get out my Legos and do a couple comics with them.
