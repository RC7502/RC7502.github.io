In case you were wondering why K-Dog gets hurt so much in the comic this <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=87>comic</a> should explain things.

I'm not much of a PC gamer but when kruton asked me to join up for some Medal of Honor LAN action I thought "cool". Today's comic isn't our exact conversation but it was pretty close. I can't really blame them for quitting early to do homework, I have my own homework not getting done because I am doing comics about not getting to play games. The way I see it this is my last week ever to procrastinate on homework. It's sort of sentimental in a lazy "not actually sentimental at all" kind of way. Anyway, I told myself I wasn't going to play anymore games until I get all my projects done. Chances are I won't make it to the weekend.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20021204.gif' alt'' />
