There is a new section to <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/system/PSP>review PSP games</a> up now. I mentioned on the podcast last night that I have stopped adding games to the database. It just became to much work to update every day. If there is a new game not in the database you can still add it at the same time you enter a review. I will never get rid of the video game reviews completely because there are a lot out there that anyone can go back and read.
