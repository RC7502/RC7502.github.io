When I saw the pilot of Lost I thought it was pretty good. When I saw Walkabout I was hooked. It was pretty awesome to let us spend a couple episodes with a character and then reveal that we really don't know anything about him. This is a Locke episode. It starts with his eye opening and the toe wiggle we'll see again in the finale. 

On the island: Locke forms a boar hunting party while Jake throws a corpse bonfire beach party.
Off the island: Locke was a desk jockey yearning for an adventure he can't have because he's (shocked face!) in a wheelchair.

At one point Locke is talking to, I'm assuming, a phone sex operator, just to have someone to talk to. He calls her Helen, and we'll meet the real Helen later on in the series. 

Q6. Will Rose and Bernard be reunited?
A6. Yes.
Q7. How did Jack see his father alive on the island?
A7. The smoke monster can take the form of dead people

Ashley's note: she felt bad for Locke because everyone was mean to him prior to the crash.
