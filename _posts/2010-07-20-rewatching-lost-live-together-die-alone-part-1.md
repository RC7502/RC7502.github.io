There's a sailboat! And who's on it, just drunk Desmond.

On the island: Things are building towards a big battle with The Others.
Off the island: Desmond gets a boat from Libby so he can sale around the world and piss off Penny's dad.

This is the first part of the season finale. Michael is leading the main characters into a trap, Locke and Eko are fighting over a button and Sayid, Sun and Jin are sailing around the island. In the flashbacks I forgot that Libby had been married before and that her husband had a boat. Ah yes we also see the 4 toed statue. We never did get an answer on why it only had 4 toes. We also see Kelvin in the hatch when Desmond crashed there. Kelvin was the army guy in Sayid's back story.
