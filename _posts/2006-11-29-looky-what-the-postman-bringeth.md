<img width="171" height="143" align="left" alt="Xbox 360" id="image981" src="http://dl.bitsmack.com/uploads/2006/11/xbox360.jpg" />Arriving today, less than a week after I ordered it, my Xbox 360 Core system. This was the special Amazon.com Thanksgiving day special, where the first 1,000 customers could buy the system for $100, a $199 savings!

I'll be putting together a more formal review later, along with one of my Wii.  Unfortunately, the only 360 games I have are the three Burger King games, although I can't wait to play Sneak King in HD. :-)
