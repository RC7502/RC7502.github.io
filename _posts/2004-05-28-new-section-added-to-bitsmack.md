As we've mentioned on the site a couple of times K-Dog and I like to play rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution. For a few months now we've been secretly working on a database of every rhythm game we know. You can check it out by clicking on <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=beatsmack&file=index>Rhythm Game Database.</a>
