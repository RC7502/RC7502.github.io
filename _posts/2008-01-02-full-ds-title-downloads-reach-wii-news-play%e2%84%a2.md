<a href="http://play.tm/story/15268">Full DS title downloads reach Wii - news - playâ„¢</a>
<blockquote> Nintendo US boss Reggie Fils-Aime has today confirmed that full-title DS downloads will soon be available on the Wii console. The new feature will allow Wii / DS owners to download full games via the console before transferring them over the handheld.</blockquote>
Just great, more stuff to fill up the measly 512mb of internal memory. If they're going to do this, I hope the first thing they do is port the Virtual Console over to the DS and let me play any VC titles I've downloaded on my Wii on my DS.
