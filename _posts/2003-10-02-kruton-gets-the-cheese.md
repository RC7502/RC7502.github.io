This week I've been up to no good. DDR in Cleveland was well.... bad. I lost in the 2nd round. But I had loads of fun playing games with all my Cleveland crew!
<br />

<br />
In gaming news, DDRMAX2 is a fantastic release! We got Extreme songs b4 the Japanese CS market!! The Japanese release of DDRMAX 2 contained several more extreme songs than our mix but we attained Xenon, Vanity Angel and a few Konami EXCLUSIVES such as Tomorrow Perfume and the DJ Naguero song that I can't remember the name of.
<br />

<br />
Aside from that I've been getting by at skool and I'm currently working on some new Bemani stuff.
<br />

<br />
Also I've been getting a few auctions on ebay for Bemani soundtracks. MMMMMM, Bemani music :)

K-dog out!!
