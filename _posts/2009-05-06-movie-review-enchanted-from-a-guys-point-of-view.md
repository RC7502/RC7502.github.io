But hey if I can play Air Fortress on my laptop I don't care what's on TV. Anyway <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011U52EC?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0011U52EC">Enchanted</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0011U52EC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is about this girl (Amy Adams aka the purse girl from season one of The Office) who is an amalgamation of all the Disney princesses. Before her wedding to Prince Cyclops she gets sent to the real world where things aren't like a cartoon. She meets Patrick Dempsey who doesn't believe in fairy tales. What will happen?? Well, about everything you expect.

Ok, I can get the concept of this movie. It contrasts the fantasy of fairy tales with reality. There are some funny examples of this where Adams talks about getting married after knowing the prince for a day, and when she suggests Dempsey sing a song to his girl friend to solve their problems. But there are a couple places where the contrast didn't hold up. First of all, while in the real world Adams can call out to animals and have them clean the house for her. Also, at the park she starts singing a song and entire crowds join in singing and dancing. I'm sure these are enjoyable scenes for kids to watch but now they've basically turned the real world into a cartoon and negated the original premise. 

The end of the movie plays out just like every Disney movie and everything happens as you would expect it to. Overall, Enchanted was enjoyable and there's really nothing to hate about it. I give it a 2.

4 = own it
3 = rent it
2 = watch it on tv while doing other things
1 = watch it just to make fun of how terrible it is
0 = never watch under any circumstances no matter how curious you are
