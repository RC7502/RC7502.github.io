<b>Movie Review: The Hulk</b>
<br />
After hearing mixed reviews I decided it was time to see this movie for myself. The Hulk is less a story about a super hero and more a story about a tortured man. I thought the plot was pretty good and the special effects scenes looked impressive. Ang Lee did a brilliant job with the camera transitions to make the movie seem more like a comic book. Some people have complained that you don't see enough of the Hulk. However, you can only have so much of the movie be him running from the Army. Overall, I thought it was a good movie. It might not please the action fans, but it should please fans of the comic.
