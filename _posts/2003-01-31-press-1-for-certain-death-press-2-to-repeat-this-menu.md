Ok I look through the pamplet I get from the cable company to see which services I want to get. Then I see that Insight also offers local phone service and it's about $5-10 less then what I was spending at Findlay. So I call them from work and I get voice mail that tells me to leave my name and number. How am I supposed to leave my number when I don't have one yet? I use my work number which is a pain because I don't have my own phone at my new job. Anyway, my cable TV is getting setup Saturday and my RoadRunner will be setup Tuesday. This will give me time to buy the wireless router I've always wanted.

In other TV news, when I moved into my apt the cable had not yet been shut off from the previous resident. I only had network stations when I was in Findlay so it's been more than 2 years since I've seen Comedy Central and MTV. Here are my impressions on cable TV. I actually watched the Osbournes a couple times and thought it was pretty good. There is a new cartoon on MTV called Clone High which is pretty funny. The animation style reminds me of the Clerks cartoons. MTV is promoting the hell out of it unlike Undergrads on Comedy Central which treats the show like it's classified material. The Cartoon Network is cool because I can watch old G.I. Joe episodes, Futurama and of course Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Lastly, I like the Dave Chappelle show on Comedy Central. It reminds me of In Living Color. When I watched the first episode I thought, "if this sketch comedy show is funny, why does Saturday Night Live continue to suck so hard?"
