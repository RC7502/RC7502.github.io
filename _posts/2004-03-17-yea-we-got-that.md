<P><a href='modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=392'>This comic</a> is based on a <A HREF='http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/12/170251&mode=nested&tid=127&tid=166&tid=186&tid=99'>thread over at Slashdot</A> where they are discussing whether the videogame market will crash in 2005.
<br />
<P>As one of the few members of the Bitsmack community that can remember the crash of 1983, I can tell you that it may happen. Games are making more money than ever, but there aren't as popular as they were in 1982. People knew who Pacman was... What Centipede was... When they discussed video games it was to discuss the Atari 2600. Atari was so big that Nintendo actually approached Atari about selling the NES. The <A HREF='http://groups.google.com/groups?q=atari+2600+total+sales&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=vidsourcEE4oGt.2JK%40netcom.com&rnum=1'>Atari 2600 sold between 17-20 million units</A> while as of May 2002 the <A HREF='http://www.psreporter.com/playstation_2_sales.html'>PS2 has US sales of 11.3 million</A>
<br />
<P>Today only a small minority actually know what Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is about and they don't know a XBox from a PSX from a PS2. Arcades are practically non-existant and people are bombarded with other uses of their entertainment money and time.
<br />
<P>So, are we heading for a crash?<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040317.gif' alt'' />
