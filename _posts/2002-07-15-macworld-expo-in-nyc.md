Yes, yes, the rumors (and comic) are true. I am leaving for MacWorld tomorrow (tuesday) at 6am and I will not be back until Saturday, but never fear because I will have computer and internet access from the show floor. I will also do my best to post updates and pictures from the show. Keep watching for updates as the week rolls on.
