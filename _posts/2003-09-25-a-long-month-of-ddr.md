MME 3 was awesome, I got 2nd in the Standard bracket. I know you're all thinkin' <I>"Why in the world was K-dog in standard??"</i> Well I just have to say if YOU'VE seen the Cleveland ppl play DDR you'd wanna be in standard too!

Speaking of Cleveland, FNS tourney is this weekend! Lynex and I will be staying the weekend at Zack's place with the infamous tub of fun.
