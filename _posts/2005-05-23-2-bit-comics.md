K-Dog <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=462>had a party.</a> Games were played.<br />
<br />
My project this week was soft modding the XBOX. K-Dog hooked me up with a memory card and Splinter Cell and 5 min later my XBOX was modded. The whole process was easier than your mom. Since then I have installed the XBOX Media Center, an NES emulator, SNES emulator and an N64 emulator. I am really impressed with the XBOX Media Center and how well it plays videos off my computer over the network. If you have an XBOX and don't mind breaking the law I recommend modding it to turn it into a cheap media PC for the living room.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20050523.png'   />
