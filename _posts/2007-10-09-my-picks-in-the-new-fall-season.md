I probably watch too much TV. That being said ever since I got a DVR that records two shows at once I have more television than I can keep up on. Therefore, here are the new shows I am keeping and the ones I am dropping:

<strong>Keeping:</strong>

<strong>Code Monkeys</strong> - I fell in love with the first episode of this cartoon that looks like River City Ransom. After a few episodes though it seems like they do a lot of the same jokes too often (Larrity being crazy, race jokes, violence, pot jokes). I am sticking with it because it is the best video game related cartoon on.

<strong>The Big Bang Theory</strong> - It could be my CBS bias but I had no hope for this new sitcom. I thought it was just going to be joke after joke at the expense of these two nerds. While there is some of that there is also some really intelligent dialog in there. I like seeing these geniuses use their book smarts in real world social situations.

<strong>Kid Nation</strong> - I know it is "reality" TV and it is probably mostly fake, but I do enjoy watching these kids work together as a team to try to figure things out. Also, they are much better behaved than adults on reality TV.

<strong>Journeyman</strong> - This was one I didn't even plan on watching but then I was hooked after the first episode. It is a lot like Quantum Leap except the main dude gets to come back to the present to deal with a struggling marriage and there is no holographic Dean Stockwell. I am a fan of time travel so I will stick with this one. On a side note, I also like that whatever year he travels to they play as song from that time period in the background.

<strong>On the fence:</strong>

<strong>Pushing Daisies</strong> - There's only been one episode so far but I enjoy the fantasy concept and the witty dialog. Also the visual style of the show is amazing. 

<strong>Dropping:</strong>

<strong>Chuck</strong> - NBC hyped the hell out of this show but I was so bored with the second episode. It doesn't have as much action as a show like Alias, but it's not as funny as Buffy or Angel. Even though the blond is hot and Jayne from Firefly is in it, it's not enough to keep me watching.

<strong>Reaper</strong> - Kevin Smith directing a TV show? Sign me up! Unfortunately, I was bored to death by the premiere. You have the guy from The Loop and the fat guy from... Invasion? I think that's right. Anyway, the whole show seemed like a rip off of Buffy except not as smart or interesting. If it doesn't get canceled I might be convinced to give it another shot. 

<strong>Grey's Anatomy</strong> - I know this isn't a new show but it's getting kicked off the DVR anyway. Grey's is watched by 98% of the US population that owns a vagina according to a statistic I just made up. I watched the season premiere and all I saw was a bunch of girls bitching at each other (I'll include George in that because he is the whiniest person on the show). With the exception of Izzie, the women on the show aren't even attractive. Meredith looks like a walking DUI photo, Christina looks like one of the aliens from Communion, and Callie is built like a pro wrestler. If I am ever injured and need to go to a hospital I hope I go to one where the people are not as emotionally messed up as Seattle Grace.
