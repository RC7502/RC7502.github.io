It's time for everyone's fav game!! How many acronyms can Kruton6 put in a post!!! Here we go! AHHHH DDR rules!! I still have the high score board in C. Meanwhile back at the lair (Dorm), I'm compiling a complete DWI package for users on campus here to share their fav songs and get them compiled for<A HREF="http://dwi.ddrei.com"> DWI (Dance With Intensity)</a> BMI (Beatmania something or other) and the new <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpd/">CPD (Cross Platform Developer)</a> for UNIX/LINUX/MAC OS X. It looks like the dawn of an era for <A HREF="http://www.ddrfreak.com">DDR</a>
<br />

<br />
If that's not enough I'm also still juggling both jobs, school and homework while trying to actually make money at all these and pay for college.
<br />

<br />
I'll keep ya'll posted on this junk, and if you're on campus and want to play a lil DWI before during or after class just map to my network drive @ loserkidsdwi$ you need Direct X 8.1 to run it and if it doesn't work make an alias adding /sdl to the end of the target file. That's it! I'm done typing! It's time 4 class!!
