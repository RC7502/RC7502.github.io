<a href="http://boardsus.playstation.com/playstation/board/message?board.id=psp&thread.id=2721693">So I got the UMD out of the case... With pics - PSPâ„¢ General - PlayStation.com Forums</a>:
<blockquote>So I got a PSP for Christmas, and it took me about 30 mins, but I finally got the "Socom Fireteam Bravo 2" UMD out of its white case. Man, Sony really needs to make it easier to get UMD's out of their case, It took me a screwdriver! Anyways, I put the UMD in the PSP, and again Sony needs to fix this, it can move around and stuff so how can the data be read? And I started up the game and my PSP makes this really loud screeching noise and it cut my FTB2 in half! Wha tthe heck!!?? Now my PSP doesn't work!! What do I do??</blockquote>
If I said it once, I'll say it again, there are just some people that shouldn't be allowed to procreate or own video games.
