You go into Gamestop and put down $5 on a game coming out next month. Essentially you are giving Gamestop a 30 day interest free loan. "But RC, interest on $5 isn't very much" you may be wondering. One word: volume. 

Now in the following calculations I have to make some assumptions. I can't find any exact statistics on how many people preordered a game from Gamestop. Let's look at Halo 3. According to <a href="http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/14720/Halo-3-Does-300-Million-FirstWeek-Sales/">this article</a> Halo 3 had 1.7 million preorders. Let's assume that Gamestop only accounted for 1 million of those, and let's say everyone that preordered only put down $5 and they did it 1 month prior to release. The best savings account interest rate I can find is 1.85% APY. I have no idea what kind of interest a large company could get. 

((1 million preorders * $5 ) * 0.0185)/12 = $7708.33

So Gamestop made about $7708 by just taking your $5 and putting your name into a computer. But when is the last time they asked you to preorder a game coming out soon? Usually what I get asked is to preorder a game that just recently was announced and doesn't even have a release date. It's coming out some vague quarter next year. Let's take our previous example but divide out the million preorders among the 10 months leading up to the games release:

Month 1 Profit = $771
Month 2 = 2314
Month 3 = 4630
Month 4 = 7720
Month 5 = 11586
Month 6 = 16229
Month 7 = 21650
Month 8 = 27850
Month 9 = 34830
Month 10 = 42593

In this example Gamestop would make $42,593 by people preordering the game rather than buy it at release day. The earlier you preorder a video game the more Gamestop makes. This is just one game, there are hundreds of games available to preorder at any point in time. Again, I am making a lot of assumptions here. You're allowed to put down any amount you want on a preorder so some of those could have been more than $5. Also, my guess is that Gamestop would invest that money in something with a higher yield than a personal savings account. Another thing to take into account are people who forget and never pick up their preorders. Gamestop may have lost a sale but they got $5 for free. This is very similar to gift cards that all stores use. Generally speaking, people don't buy a gift card and then immediately use it. For the period of time between when you purchase a gift card and you or someone else uses it, the store is earning interest off of your cash. 

I'm not saying that Gamestop is wrong in taking preorders. There are some people that want to make sure a game is in stock on release day for them to pick up. Gamestop is providing a service to them. However, I can't think of a time where I didn't preorder a game and had trouble finding it on release day.

Question of the day: Name a game that you wanted to buy on release day or maybe a day or two after and it was sold out at every store. I am talking about software only, no consoles or games that require special hardware i.e. Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Wii Fit.
