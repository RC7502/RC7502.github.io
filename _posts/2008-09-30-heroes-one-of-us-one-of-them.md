Though not as many surprises as last week, this weeks episode was still pretty cool.

Spoilers and full review after the jump...

<!--more-->

<strong>Mama Petrelli, Sylar and Noah</strong>

Last week Mama P. told Sylar she was his mom. I thought she was speaking metaphorically but this week she's like "no, for reals, I put you up for adoption." I'm still pretty sure she's just lying to him to keep him under control. It turns out Sylar can't help himself when he kills super powered people. He has to feed off of them like a vampire. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_series">Everyone loves vampires!</a> Then Mama P. does the most badass thing and leads a woman into Sylar's cell for him to feed on. Harsh! The woman had the ability to touch an object and see it's history, kinda like Johnny Smith on The Dead Zone. Have you ever picked up something off the ground to put in your mouth and someone else is like "dude, you don't know where that's been", well this was the woman you would want to have around when that comes up. Anyway, Sylar becomes Noah's new partner because they have some baddies to round up.

<strong>Everyone be cool this is a robbery</strong>

The Frightful Four made up of Magneto, Blue Pyro (because his flames are blue), Peevil (Peter in Weevil's body) and Scarecrow (technically he is only powered by fear instead of using fear as a weapon but I don't have a better name for him right now) decide to rob a bank. Magneto wants to take the money and run but Scarecrow wants revenge against the company. Scarecrow then punches a hole through Magneto thus ending his chances to become the leader of Genosha someday.

Noah and Sylar roll up discussing what a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is called in France. Noah flashes a badge that came out of a cereal box and Sylar does his best NYPD Blue impression and they are immediately in charge of the police. Noah goes into the bank unarmed and without Sylar (the one who has everyone's powers) which seems like a brilliant plan but then he gets captured. Peter realizes that Weevil has Banshee's powers and knocks everyone around. After putting right what once went wrong Future Peter shows up and puts Peter back in his own body and takes him to the future. Sidenote: did Future Peter take Peter to Future Peter's future or the new future that was created after Future Peter shot Nathan? With Weevil back in control of his own body things look bad for Noah again until Sylar shows up and kicks everyone's collective asses like he should have done in the first place. Sylar's treat for being a good boy is that he gets to snack on Weevil which is great because now Sylar has super hearing and a super scream. Unless he lost super hearing when he lost all his other powers. Oh well I can't keep track of all the powers he has anymore.

<strong>Claire</strong>

Claire wants to drop out of school and become a full time hero, which I actually agree with. I mean if you're indestructible are you really going to live out your days in some boring job? Claire's biological mom Girl Pyro decides to knock some since into her by taking her in storage container and suffocating her, but Girl Pyro doesn't suffocate herself some how. Claire admits she doesn't want to be a hero she just wants to hurt Sylar. Then she lies about going with some friends to pass the spirit stick or whatever cheerleaders do and instead takes her dads files on a road trip.

<strong>Hiro, Ando and Flashette</strong>

Hiro and Ando track Flashette to a silent movie theater (those even exist?) where TheHatian is making a trade for the other half of The Chemistry Notes of DOOM. This leads to the best line in the episode:

(Hiro distracts TheHatian, Ando hits TheHatian over the head)
Hiro: What are you doing?
Ando: I'm being awesome!

With TheHatian knocked out, Flashette steals the The Chemistry Notes of DOOM and gets away. So this is the second time Hiro has actually helped Flashette. TheHatian wakes up and Hiro and Ando end up in Level 5.

<strong>Parkman</strong>

Parkman is still in Africa with the African Mr. Isaac (AMI). AMI has been painting Parkman's life on rocks since he was a kid. One of the paintings is Parkman with a wife and kid, but then AMI is all like "nah that's too happy" and replaces it with Parkman holding a dead woman. At the end Parkman takes some drugs and his eyes go all white too. Speculation: does this mean that drugs give people the ability to see the future? Probably!

<strong>Tracy</strong>

Tracy finds Nathan reading the Bible (still religious!) and shows him the Vegas video. "When did we do it?" Tracy wonders. Nathan is like, "that's Niki Sanders, and also I believe that video should have STAYED in Vegas". Tracy heads to New Orleans. There she finds that Niki did die in a fire. Micah uses his super cross referencing powers to find out that Niki and Tracy were born in the same hospital on the same day with the same doctor. Tracy goes and finds the doctor who says something along the lines that he made her. It's like Twins except that one of them didn't turn out like Danny Devito. Although I don't see how Tracy and Niki can be test tube babies since they clearly have belly buttons.

<strong>Misc</strong>
I just realized why I liked this episode, we didn't see Mohinder doing stupid things again! Also, are Micah and Monica's storyline done for now? With Molly in India does this mean we don't get any superkids this season? I suppose we don't need MORE storylines going on at once.
