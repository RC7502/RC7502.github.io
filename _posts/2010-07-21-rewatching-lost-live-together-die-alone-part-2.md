Charlie and Eko want to blow open the room with dynamite so they can push the button. It's like the season 1 finale all over again.

In the present: Michael trades the gang for Walt and the button doesn't get pressed.
Flashback: We find out the hatch prevents an electro magnetism build up and there is a fail safe. 

The big reveal in this episode is that Desmond was responsible for crashing Oceanic 815. The hatch blows up, but it blows up in a "not actually harmful to anyone" sort of way. Then at the end there is a cool scene with a base in Antarctica that detects the island and tells Penny about it. Now on to Season 3!
