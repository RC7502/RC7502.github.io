So I have come to the realization that FFCC is only 7 days away!!!! The game I drooled over months ago when I played the Japanese version is FINALLY, FINALLY coming to the states!!!! I'm so excited I even posted on Bitsmack! No seriously I've been busy as of late trying to fix my english class I didn't pass last semester, keep up with work as well as school and purchase my ddr machine. For those of you who don't know my ddr machine will be going in at Club 180 in Kenton. It's a Christian youth center and what better way to worship than by playing on my ddr machine?? :)
<br />
Anyway, after DDR I hope to make enough money in a year or two to get a Pop N Music machine but that prolly won't happen since I'll need a job here in a year and a half when I graduate. Then the party will never stop!! :)

K-dog out!!
