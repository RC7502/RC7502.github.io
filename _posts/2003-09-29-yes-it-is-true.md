Yes, it is true, I am now an owner of a Platinum "Limited Edition" Nintendo Game Cube (why platinum? It matches my GBA SP). I have this unwritten rule of not buying a video game system until it drops below $100. The XBox and PS2 will have to wait now. It's really not that hard to wait. Any game that comes out for the XBox will come out for the PC and drop to $20 pretty quickly. It's a little harder waiting for the PS2, since there are a couple of games that I would really like to play on it.
