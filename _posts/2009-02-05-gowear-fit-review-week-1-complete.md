The first week is done and I am down about a pound. It's better than going up! it was hard to stick to my diet with a Super Bowl party on Sunday but oh well. Here's what I think of the device so far:

Pros:
Very accurate count of calories burned for the day.
I definitely recommend the optional display watch to get positive feedback throughout the day.
Measures your sleep and you can see how much you toss and turn at night.
Software provides cool graphs and is very easy to use.
Tech support was helpful and replied quickly to my questions.

Cons:
No way to turn off sounds on the armband when you put it on and take it off.
Diet tracking is not as good as other sites out there (I use The Daily Plate).
No Firefox support for Mac, only Safari.
Software requires a paid subscription plan.
Takes a long time to charge (3-4 hours) if you let the battery drain all the way.

Overall I am happy with the device and none of these cons were deal breakers for me. One of the biggest shocks for me is seeing how few calories I burn when I'm at the computer or watching TV. It is BARELY more than sleeping. No wonder there are so many overweight computer nerds. It is nice to see how many calories I burn when I'm walking around the mall or doing things around the house. Let's see if I can stick to my diet better and lose some more weight this week!
