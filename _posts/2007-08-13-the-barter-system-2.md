Crap, I have to write a blog post to explain my comic. What is this, <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade?</a> Anyway, Saturday night Jason, Will, Jeff, Kim, Katie, Jim Hoss and I played Settlers of Catan until about 3:30 am. I would try to explain what the game is about but every time I attempted to in the past it sounds so stupid trying to put it into words. You get to trade wheat for wood? Hot dog! Sign me up! That being said it is one of the most addictive board games I've played in a long time. I think what makes it great is that you can potentially get stuff every turn. In our games it seems like the score is usually pretty close unlike a game like Magic or Chess where experienced players dominate over newbies. I think if I had to compare it to another game it reminds me of Monopoly. Trading is important, and a couple of good dice rolls can really turn things around for you. Therefore, this week I am getting Settlers of Catan 5 out of 5 Sheep.
