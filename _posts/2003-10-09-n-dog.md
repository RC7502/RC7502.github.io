Well folks I hate to say it but, <B>"I AM A SELLOUT!"</B> I went into Gamestop today and was joking around and took an N-gage box up to the counter. As a joke I pretended I was going to buy it. Then the person working asks me, "Are you serious?!" and I said "HECK NO!!" So he says mine is pretty cool if you wanna try it....
<br />

<br />
So then it hits me... Should K-dog get an N-gage? I ask him if he has it and if I can play it. He gladly hands it to me and says I should buy one. I'm totally serious about getting one now!! I currently have T-mobile service with my palm phone and I'm looking for an upgrade. The N-gage would be AWESOME! Bluetooth, games, phone, organizer, color, and everything else I could possibly want! In addition to all that, MONKEY BALL!! I've always loved nokia and this may get me back into their scene :o)

In site news RC is gone! K-dog and Goz will rule! Also I have no idea if there will be a comic tomorrow. I apologize to our 4 die hard fans who we have never met :)

K-dog out!!
