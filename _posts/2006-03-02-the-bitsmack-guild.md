For those of you wondering what happened to the Bitsmack guild here is the full story. I wanted the guild to be for all my friends and just have a good time. K-Dog on the other hand just wanted to do high level raids every night. Since there were only a couple level 60s in the group that made things difficult. So then he decided to make fun of me every single night for not playing enough. The whole point of any video game is to have fun and he made Warcraft not fun for me. I finally told him to go join another guild and he did. The grown-up thing for him to do would have been to make me guild leader so those of us that stayed could continue on. Instead he disbanded the guild, because if K-Dog's not having fun, no one else is allowed.

So now I need 10 people to get online and sign the charter for the new Bitsmack guild. Here are the rules for anyone joining the Bitsmack guild:

1. the primary goal is to have fun 
2. we take characters at any level
3. no one will be looked down upon or made fun of for any reason
4. trade is encouraged among the guild
5. the secondary goal is to have fun

To help get the guild back up send a message in game to Rc. To new beginnings!
