<a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/commentary/games/2007/04/gamesfrontiers_0423">What Type of Game Cheater Are You? -</a>:<blockquote>A month ago while playing Final Fantasy XII, I fought my way to Tiamat, a vicious, huge-clawed dragon -- and couldn't get past him. No matter how many ways I threw my team at the beast, he ripped us to ribbons. Screw it. I decided to check an online FAQ for some hints defeating this thing.  "That's cheating," a friend of mine scoffed. "Really?" I wondered. Personally, I've always figured that using a FAQ might be lame -- like reading the Cliff's Notes version of War and Peace -- but it isn't cheating. It's not like I'm hacking the game with a Game Genie to illicitly acquire extra lives, right?</blockquote>
