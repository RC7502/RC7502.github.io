It was nine years ago today that Billy Mitchell played the first ever <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/07/dayintech_0703">perfect game of Pac-Man</a>, amassing 3,333,360 points over 255 boards in more than 6 hours. (Pac-Man has a bug at screen 256 which causes the machine to mess up. There is a rumor that an 8 year old navigated this "split screen" level, but it has not been verified. More info over at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man">Wikipedia</a>.)<br /><blockquote></blockquote>
