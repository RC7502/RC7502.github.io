When I got back from New Orleans, I wasn't expecting <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=343>this.</a>
<br />

The Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference was ok. There wasn't anything there that would interest a normal person. However after hours, Microsoft knows how to throw a party. Thursday night they rented out the House of Blues and we had free drinks the whole night. The band was really good and the fake Blues Brothers even came out to sing a couple songs. Friday night not only was the House of Blues rented out, but the whole street was blocked off for Microsoft partners. This time the band was none other than Smashmouth. Afterwards we walked a couple blocks to Bourbon street. It wasn't anything spectactular, but it also wasn't spring break. All in all it was a pretty good time.<Br><br>
