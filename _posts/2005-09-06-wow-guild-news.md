Hey all!<br />
<b>We're going to start running deadmines this week.</b><br />
Please post to <a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=109">this thread</a> with when you will be available to run and we'll setup a schedule.  This will not be a high level pull run.  Keep in mind you are required to be level 20 or higher.<br />
<b>I am now level 60!</b><br />
Congrats to our first and only level 60, ME!<br />
Kruton has now made it to level 60 and my goal for the week is to have ikevi up to 30 by the end of the week.  If anyone else has a 51-60 character I'll probably be playing battlegrounds more often now.<br />
<b>Brother guild</b><br />
We are now semi-teamed with the <i>Delta Strike Force</i> guild.  They are a group of individuals who are friends of some of our members as well as mine.  They seem to be a higher level frame and have around 30 active members.  Get to know them, they're good people :)<br />
They have a website but I can't google it so I can't find it...<br />
Maybe a joining of forums over here perhaps?  We'll see after I talk to their GM :)<br />
See you on the server,<br />
K-dog out!
