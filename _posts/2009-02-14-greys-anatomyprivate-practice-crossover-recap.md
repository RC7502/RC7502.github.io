Grey's Anatomy/Private Practice Crossover Extravaganza!!!

I started to write a recap for last week's, but the episode weren't really crossed over. It was more setup than anything else. Plus, there was so much going on, just my Grey's recap was about 60 paragraphs long. I tried to slim it down this time, and keep it brief. But this was two hours, so yeah, it's long.

Note: I have absolutely no medical training or anything like that, so I don't know the correct terminology, and even when they say it, there's no way I could actually spell the names of these illnesses and diseases and treatments and what not. I'm very big on correct spelling, so I'm not going to attempt it. I'm going to just write it how it makes sense to me. [/disclaimer]

<!--more-->

Izzie is making crafts, trying to explain to Karev that the interns aren't as useless as they seem, they just need to have some fun. So she makes them glittery envelopes, tells the interns not to open them, because it's part of the game. Apparently the interns are in kindergarten. While making the crafts, she couldn't find the scissors that were right in front of her, and she snapped at an intern who tried to open their envelope. Maybe these are signs of things to come.

Cristina and the chief are taking care of an old man who said the problem was his hernia acting up in front of his daughter, Beth, but when she left the room he told them that he'd had cancer but didn't tell his daughter. He asked them not to tell her, and the chief said, "Alright, but I need your old medical records, so where were you treated?" Owen comes in and rattles off the hospital name, then says to the old man, "Guess what! I work here now!" The old man said, "You broke off your engagement to my daughter, therefore you suck."

Callie and Karev are still taking care of the pregnant woman (Jen) who ran over her husband (Rob) because of an aneurysm or whatever in her head that Derek was supposed to operate on. Karev tells Jen and Rob that because of a last minute emergency, Jen's surgery was being pushed back a little. Callie asked what the emergency was, and Karev said that Archer Montgomery was admitted the night before. To which Callie replies, "WTF? Addison's here? Awesome!"

Addison and Naomi came over from Private Practice because Addison's brother (and Naomi's sort-of boyfriend), Archer, has a parasite in his brain. Addison's ex-husband Derek is the best neurosurgeon to ever not exist, so they brought Archer to him. Naomi tried to rekindle her friendship with Derek, which was fairly unsuccessful. She and Archer sang a song that Derek wrote for Addison and sang at their wedding, with Meredith present. Addison tried to stop them (not sure either of them realized that was Meredith), then Mark came in, Meredith said the song was funny, and all was fine. Derek had done some tests, or something, and when he came into Archer's room, he told them that apparently he can't operate on Archer without rupturing something, which would kill him.

Meredith whines to Cristina that Derek never told her that he played guitar or that Addison had a brother. Cristina counters with, "Oh, yeah? My boyfriend's ex-fiance is in the hospital." Point, set and match.

Sam (Naomi's ex-husband) shows up. Bailey is a little rude to him, not realizing who he was, then apologizes and points him in the right direction, but telling him that Derek's not having much luck.

Addison begs Derek to find a way to help her brother. "I need you to be a god." Because apparently Derek can just snap his fingers and make that happen.

Inside the interns envelopes was a surgical procedure. They had to prep their dummies for the surgery. Lexi breezed through everything, Sadie was falling behind. She didn't seem happy about it. After their dummies were properly prepped, George gave them a new envelope, and they had to complete that task. They had to find specific doctors in the hospital, ask for their "symptoms" (which Izzie and George assigned), and when they got it right, the doctors (as of now Mark and Cristina had been approached) gave them a new envelope. I vaguely remember a game like this in high school in one of the history classes. I didn't take that class.

Mark tries to flirt with Lexi when she asks for his symptoms. She tells him she'll respond when he's willing to go public with their relationship. He gives her his symptoms, she yells out the disease, Sadie overhears, George accuses her of cheating, then gives Mark new symptoms.

Beth goes back to the hospital and is seven kinds of thrilled to see Owen. Once she gets over the, "OMG, I totally thought you were still in Iraq! I just saw your mom and she didn't say anything!" shock. She hugs him, and Cristina stands there, kinda pissed off.

Addison is in the hospital chapel. Sam, Naomi, Callie and Mark (I think it was Mark; I don't remember now) are standing in the doorway, watching, and debating amongst themselves if she's praying ("Addison doesn't pray") or hiding. Finally Addison turned around and says, "You know I'm in earshot and can hear every word you're saying, right?" Callie joins her, and the others leave. Addison confesses that she doesn't know how to pray, and that God doesn't know who she is anyway, so why would He help her? Callie says a prayer, asking for help over her new girl crush, then assures Addison that being a baby saver, God knows who she is.

Sam finds Derek, and they apologize to each other for not keeping in touch. Derek explains why he can't operate on Archer (because there's too many). Sam tells asks him how he would remove the individual ones, and they look closer at the scan.

Sadie goes to check Jen's baby's heartbeat as part of the game. Izzie, George and Karev are supervising. Sadie can't find the heartbeat, and Jen flips out. Karev rolls his eyes, tells Sadie she's got the sonogram thing on the baby's ass, then moves it where the heart is. Lo and behold, there's the heartbeat. Meredith comes in to see what's up. Jen asks about her surgery, and Meredith tells her any time now.

Owen tells Cristina he's not the terrible person she thinks he is. She asks if his mother knows he's back from Iraq. He doesn't answer, and she walks away.

Sam and Derek go into Archer's room with a plan on how to operate. Addison gets excited ("You can control the ruptures?!"), and Archer says no. Derek calls him a coward, challenging him to take the chance on the surgery. Archer does not looked pleased with that adjective.

Jen began to get upset because she hadn't had her surgery yet. Karev told her to calm down, then pulled up a picture of her baby on a monitor. He told her to focus on that, and stay calm.

Beth's father started coughing up blood, so he had to go into emergency surgery. Beth still has no idea what's going. While in surgery, Cristina spots a tumor, and the chief says they need to tell Beth everything. Owen didn't want to.

Archer took the bait, and agreed to the surgery. Addison and friends watched from the observing room. Sam and Mark kind of laughed over Bailey being a pediatric surgeon since she doesn't smile. Everything's going well in the beginning, and Addison says she needs a distraction. Callie says, "Mark's really good at talking about himself." So he starts rattling off a bunch of nonsense. Addison stares at him blankly, and Callie explains that he met Lexi (without using her name, of course). Derek gets 7 out of the 8 parasites out of Archer's brain successfully, but when he goes for the last one, it slips.

Derek goes after the fallen parasite and manages to grab hold of it, and remove it. Addison got her wish: Derek was a god for a day.

Meredith and Cristina watch Derek talk with Addison, Sam, Naomi and Mark. Meredith makes a comment about how weird it was that Derek had this whole life before her that she knew nothing about, so it felt as though she didn't know him. Cristina says she doesn't know Owen either, and walks away. Cristina walks away a lot, I've noticed.

Karev and Izzie set up a scotch tape ribbon for the winner of the game. Karev handed her the tape, and she missed it, like she didn't see it, or her depth perception was way off. Karev is starting to notice that something's not right, and hopefully we'll find out soon what's killing Izzie. Anyway, Lexi won Izzie's game. The chief awarded her with the prize of being able to scrub in on Derek's surgery (on Jen, I'm guessing). Seeing as how all the interns are on probation and banned from the ORs, this is a major prize. She gets to hold the Doomsday Sucker.

George confronts Sadie about how terribly she did in the game, and offers to help her, since he'd been a repeat intern. She said she didn't need any help, and stormed off. She's going to kill someone, I'm sure of it.

Owen tells Beth they removed a bowel from her father. (A bowel? Is there more than one? Yes, I'm aware of how dumb a question that is, but like I said, zero medical knowledge/training, and I don't recall ever going over anatomy in school. I remember learning how the circulatory system works, and things like that, but I couldn't tell you where or what a jugular is.) She tells him he doesn't look the same. He tells her all about her father's medical history, the cancer (some type of colon cancer, I believe) and everything. She sits there, shocked, and he walks away. Something he and Cristina have in common.

Owen finds Cristina and explains to her that he talks to his mother once a week, but hasn't told her he's back because she would look at him the same way Beth did, and he couldn't take that. He said only Cristina really looks at him and sees him, and that he wanted to stay with her.

Sadie talks to the chief after George tells her to, and she quits. She confesses to Meredith that she cheated her way into the program, and thought it would be a swell idea for her and Meredith to drop everything and fly to Europe. Meredith tells her to grow up.

Karev asks Izzie what's wrong with her. She said nothing. I don't think he believes her.

Addison observes Mark and Lexi talking, and realizes something's going on with them. She introduces herself to Lexi, and when Derek comes over, she almost blows their cover. Derek says that he talked to Jen, and she insisted on having her surgery that night instead of the morning, so Lexi goes off, super psyched to hold the Doomsday Sucker. She actually had to use it during the procedure, too. Scary, but all worked out.

When Addison nearly blew Mark and Lexi's cover in front of Derek, Mark quickly cut her off by mentioning that Derek was going to propose to Meredith (insert Addison's shocked face). Addison, Mark, Sam and Naomi go to a bar and wait on Derek. When he gets there, they buy him a drink, then serenade him with the song he wrote for Addison, much to his horror. Audra McDonald and Taye Diggs have amazing voices. If you've never seen any of their musical work, I recommend checking it out.

Jen is gasping for air. Karev screams at someone to page Derek.

<strong>PRIVATE PRACTICE</strong>

Dell, Violet, Pete and Cooper are sitting around their office, in a near state of panic, waiting to hear from Addison, Naomi or Sam. Violet tries to keep everyone calm, but Dell wants to call. Violet says, "If the waiting sucks this much for us, imagine how hard it is on them."

Cut to the bar in Seattle. Addison, Naomi, Sam and Mark and dancing around, celebrating. Derek's on the phone, since Karev just had him paged because of Jen. He hangs up the phone and says he has to go back to work. They ask if it's about Archer, he says no. Naomi wonders aloud if he lying, and they all bolt to the hospital.

When they get to Archer's room, Bailey's in there, checking his charts. They ask where Derek is, she says she doesn't know. Archer starts to come to, asks for Naomi then said something about a sock? Bailey assures them it's the drugs and that he'll be fine. Sam is sucking on his inhaler, then collapses. from an asthma attack. Naomi ponders if it's her fault.

Cooper tells Charlotte that Archer's okay, since Archer works for her. She says, "Yeah, whatever" since she's still pissed off about Cooper moving in with Violet. He tries to convince her to try to get to know Violet.

Cooper has a patient, and a little baby named Cynthia, who's mother (Rachel) accidentally let her slip while she was in the tub. She rambles and laughs hysterically, so Cooper figures she hasn't been getting much sleep. He asks Violet to talk to her, and she continues to ramble.

Archer says his vision is blurry, and he thinks Derek missed something. He requests another CT. Addison passes this message on to Derek, and he refuses to do it. He tells Addison about Jen, and she tells him to get a dobbler (I believe is what she said), because the problem with Jen's breathing could be her baby.

Addison explained to Jen and Rob (and Karev and Derek) that what could be happening is that something's wrong with the baby, and whatever's happening to the baby happens to the mother, too. It sounded like she called it mirroring. I should really turn on the closed captioning when I watch this, but I don't know how to do that on this TV. And it turned out that was what the problem was. Addison told Karev to check it again, just to be sure. He asked her advice on whether leaving was a good decision for her, because while he's in love with Izzie, he feels the urge to run.

Bailey checks in with Archer, who's being an ass, then goes to check in on Sam. She asks him how Naomi could go from him to Archer. Sam thanks her for the compliment. They discuss whether his asthma attack could've been psychological, him hearing Naomi coo over Archer and all. No matter how okay you are with your break up, divorce, whatever it is, it's still never easy to see someone you once loved with someone else.

The chief tells Bailey that they're running a CT on Archer, against Derek's wishes, because he's having the story published, and he couldn't share the miracle story if it wasn't truly a miracle. Bailey says okay.

Pete give Rachel acupuncture to try to calm her down and get her to sleep. Violet calls her husband, and he agrees to sign Rachel into the hospital for a few days, because it's not just sleep deprivation, it's postpartum psychosis. Rachel comes tearing out of the room, all these pins sticking out of her face and head, saying she hears Cynthia crying. Pete and Violet chase her down, and sure enough, Cynthia was crying. Cooper was holding her, and Dell was about to give her a bottle. Rachel tried to coax them into give Cynthia to her, but Violet told them not to. Rachel then broke down and confessed that when Cynthia went underwater in the bath, when she went to go grab her, she held her down for a minute, thinking that no one would know until her husband came home for dinner, and that in the meantime she could finally sleep. Excellent parenting. Should they send her to jail, or the loony bin?

Violet panics, wondering what will happen when her baby is born, if she'll be like Rachel. Cooper assures her that she won't be, that what Rachel has is rare, and he'll be there to help her. Then he surprises her by telling her that they're having lunch with Charlotte. This is never shown, so I'm guessing it's for a later episode.

Naomi and Addison discuss whether or not Sam still has feelings for Naomi. In front of him. He says he's over her, then has another asthma attack.

Naomi goes to sit in on Archer's CT. Bailey tells her she can't do that, because she's not Archer's doctor, and girlfriends aren't family. Naomi asks what Bailey plans to do about Sam, because his meds aren't working, and she's his wife, so she can ask. Bailey says, "Uh, you're his EX-wife." She then gives up and tells Naomi she can stay. Mark comes in, and tells Naomi and she and Archer give him hope for his relationship with Lexi.

Derek goes off on Addison for not giving him Jen's tests results right away. Addison lies and says the tests were inconclusive and that's why she hadn't told him anything. When the next set of tests came back, Addison told Derek that the baby was anemic, and their best shot would be to take the baby out. Derek says that's a bad idea, because the baby's only 24 weeks, but Addison tells him it's either take the baby out and risk losing the baby, or leave the baby in and risk losing them both.

Jen refuses the procedure, saying 24 weeks is too soon. She said she had a book that said babies at 26 weeks could live, so she asked for two more weeks. Addison tried to explain that she didn't have two weeks. Rob tried to get all the information, asking if that was the only way. Addison said yes, Derek said no, that there was another way that would leave the baby in. Addison said it was very, very risky and not practical, but Jen said to do it anyway. Addison tried to comfort Derek, saying what happened to Jen wasn't his fault.

Pete and Violet talked to Rachel's husband, who couldn't understand what happened to his wife. Pete went off on a tangent, saying if she wasn't telling him how she was feeling, or telling him anything, it wasn't his fault. Clearly meant to be a dig at Violet.

Bailey still can't figure out what's wrong withÂ  Sam, even after they refilled his inhaler. Naomi told them he had an allergy to something in the generic kind, which is what Bailey used. His asthma attacks were not panic attacks, they were allergic reactions. Sam laughed, and proudly declared, "I am NOT pathetic! I am a man! I am a man with ASTHMA!" Then he had Bailey do a fist bump with him. Taye Diggs, always awesome.

Addison and Derek argue while performing surgery on Jen. Addison said that during their entire relationship, no matter how hard she tried or how good her intentions were, she was always the screw up, and Derek was always the hero. And then they accomplished....whatever it was in Jen they were trying to accomplish.

Violet and Pete are having a heavy debate about whether or not Rachel should be allowed to be near Cynthia while being treated. Cooper stepped in and repeated what Violet said, about the situation not being about her and Pete, and told Violet to think rationally, and that he'd support her expert medical opinion. Violet said she didn't think Rachel should be near her, and Pete stormed out. Cooper felt bad, and he leaned over and hugged Violet, who was holding Cynthia. At that moment, of course, Charlotte walked by and saw the three of them, happy family pose and all.

Archer's speech is still a little slurred, and he asks why Derek hasn't come back with his CT results. The chief says he's in surgery, and hands Archer the results. Archer pulls them out and looks at them. Naomi asks what's wrong, and Archer points out two cysts that Derek missed. He didn't get out all the parasites, which means Archer is still going to die.

Derek comes storming in, after the chief showed him Archers results. He told him that it's common for cyst-like thing to appear in the scans, but they're nothing and will be gone in a month. Of course, he does this AFTER Archer confesses to Mark that he slept with two of his old girlfriends and crashed his car, and after he told Naomi he had feelings for her and felt guilty about dying and leaving her alone.

Bailey and Sam stood outside Archer's room, watching him and Naomi. She told Sam that because of him, she was going to go appreciate her husband, because she didn't want to watch her life go by without her, like he was doing. He said it wasn't his life anymore. God, I hope Sam and Naomi get back together.

Violet came to her senses and let Rachel be with Cynthia, so long as she was supervised. Pete lectured her about being selfish about how she's handling her baby situation.

Charlotte told Cooper that while she understands what he's doing for Violet, living with her and helping her with the baby, there comes a time when a man and a woman can't be best friends, because he's supposed to put another woman (girlfriend/fiance/wife) ahead of her. "I'm supposed to be your best friend," she told him.

Derek and Addison tell Rob and Jen that the procedure worked, and that they baby was fine. Jen started talking, coherently at first, but then nothing made sense. Derek got out his little flashlight and looked at her eyes. Rob asked what was wrong with her, and the episode ended.

Next week is the conclusion of the Grey's/PP crossover. Looks pretty intense. I might recap that too. I'm very interested in seeing why Derek and Mark start throwing punches.
