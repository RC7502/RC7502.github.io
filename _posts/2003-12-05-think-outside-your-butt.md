Today's <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=363>comic</a> happened to the guy ahead of me in line. 
<br />

<br />
He didn't get mad but he did have to explain his order at least four or five times. When his food finally did come up (are you ready for this), the order was still wrong! Surprisement! 
<br />

<br />
So anyway the holiday season is upon us. It's time for me to take a break from my hobbies like crochet and making up words to buy Christmas presents. While Monday I demonstrated my disgust with shopping during this season I have now decided to buy all my gifts online. Buying online has so many advantages. I don't have to fight crowds, I can find exactly what I want and I don't have to wear pants. Take that Best Buy! Best Buy's acceptable clothing policies aside I should get back to my shopping now if I want to get these items by Christmas.

Wait, did I say crochet? I meant croquet.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031205.gif' alt'' />
