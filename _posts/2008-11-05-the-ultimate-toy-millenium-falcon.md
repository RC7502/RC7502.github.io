<a href="http://www.gadgettastic.com/2008/11/03/the-star-wars-millennium-falcon/">The Star Wars Millennium Falcon</a><br /><blockquote>Really, this toy has it all. Loads of movie accurate sounds and lights (the engine start up will even randomly â€œfailâ€ just like the real ship!), multiple firing projectiles, removable panels for in-ship play, a never-before-made/seen dockable mini-fighter, and bantha-buttloads more. You can recreate virtually every movie scene inside it too, as itâ€™s so roomy. So, gather up your Star Wars figures and clear off your bed - itâ€™s time to play with the big toys! May the force be with you.</blockquote>
