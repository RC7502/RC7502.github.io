Looks like <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/11/19/house-of-the-dead-heading-to-the-wii">House of the Dead is heading to the Wii!</a> I only wished that now that the Wii supports USB keyboards that they would also include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead">Typing of the Dead</a>.
