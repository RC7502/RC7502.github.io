Nothing exciting ever happens in my life and usually bad stuff comes in strings all day. Take yesterday for example. I kicked off the day by waking p at my normal time, a half-hour after my alarm went off (7:45am, alarm is set for 7:15am) Jumped in my car and headed to work.
<br />

<br />
From there I needed a FW HD to continue a project I'm working on, but little did I know that a friend of mine was using the drive that I selected that was all nicely wrapped up and with the other HD's in our cabinet. I checked the drive to see what was on it and it wouldn't show up on either Mac I tried it on.  So I thought there was someting wrong with the drive and formatted it and started using it. Then when my friend came in to start on his project he was a little overwhelmed because he hadn't backed up anything. Man, that makes a person feel terrible and I'm really sorry if you're reading this :(
<br />

<br />
So then my boss from the other job calls and says he needs me to help move out a lab. No prob I say and I switch my schedule really quick and head over there.
<br />
2 bleeding rug burns and 2 slit wrists later and I'm finally going to get lunch. The boss had got us all pizza b/c moving labs is hard. 
<br />

<br />
Following lunch I slammed my knee into a metal corner on the stage in this lab, and yea, that still hurts, then when we're all done we find that a machine I was using wasn't working so now I have to swap out the bad parts today. 
<br />

<br />
What a wonderful day!!
