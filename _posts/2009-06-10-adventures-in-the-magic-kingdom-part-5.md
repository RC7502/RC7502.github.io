Next up was Disney's Hollywood Studios. I was excited for this park because I watch a lot of movies. According to <a href="http://www.flickchart.com/chill182">Flickchart</a>, I've seen over 700 of them. Weatherly speaking this was one of the nicest days. It didn't start raining until we were heading back to the hotel at night.

<strong>Star Tours</strong>
There were a lot of Star Wars related signs and toys everywhere, and why not, Star Wars is awesome. We went on the Star Tours ride and I thought to myself it was strangely familiar, but I had never been to Hollywood Studios before. I found out later they have the same ride at Disneyland. It's basically a ride where you are watching a video and the cabin moves around to simulate space flight. There was a kid who was barely tall enough to be on the ride and he was squirming and screaming before we even sat down. He didn't stop screaming the entire ride. In front of me I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_court">Bull Shannon's</a> big bald head blocking the center of the screen. Needless to say our first Star Tour was effectively ruined. We went back on the ride later in the day and was in the front row, it was AWESOME.

<strong>Indiana Jones Stunt Show</strong>
I'm a big Indiana Jones fan even despite the latest movie so I was excited for this show. It had a stuntman navigate a cave of traps, then some fight scenes, then they re-enacted the plane sequence from Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was all very awesome.

<strong>Muppets 3D Movie</strong>
Another 3D movie. It was pretty enjoyable. 

<strong>Pizza Planet</strong>
I thought it was cool eating dinner from the pizza place in Toy Story. My big complaint was that they didn't have a claw machine where you could win those green aliens from the movie. That seems like a no-brainer. 

<strong>Mama Melrose's Italian Restaurant</strong>
I don't know why we went to two pizza places in one day but it was probably because pizza is great. This was our sit down lunch and since we just got engaged the waitress gave us glasses of champagne on the house.  

<strong>Studio Backlot Tour</strong>
A typical tour where we got to see props and vehicles from movies as well as areas where they make costumes and sets. I was really excited to see the ship from Flight of the Navigator, one of the sand speeders from Return of the Jedi and a snowspeeder from Empire Strikes Back. 

<strong>Toy Story Arcade</strong>
This was the coolest ride at the park. You are in a cart and you have to shoot targets on video screens just like in an old timey shooting gallery. It was like the Buzz Lightyear ride only more fun because the guns were way more accurate. As soon as we got off the ride we got right back in line and rode it again. The funniest thing is that there is a robot Mr. Potato Head that talks to people as you wait in line. He did a joke where he pulled his ear out, but then the robot dropped the ear completely. I was wondering how he was going to pick that up and sure enough, he couldn't. We were through the line before we saw how he ever got his ear back.

<strong>Prince Caspian</strong>
Right next to the coolest thing at Hollywood Studios was the lamest thing. Basically you walk into a room that looks like a cave. Then on the wall they recap all the major scenes in the movie Prince Caspian. What was the point of this? If I had already seen the movie I would have known all that and if I hadn't seen the movie it just spoiled it for me. Completely pointless. 

<strong>The Little Mermaid Musical</strong>
I liked all these musicals we saw because they basically summed up the whole movie in like 20-30 min. Even cooler is that Ashley went to high school with the girl who was playing Ariel. 

<strong>Beauty and the Beast Musical</strong>
Probably my favorite show at the park, it was a really fun production of Beauty and the Beast. 

<strong>Animation Demonstration</strong>
This was a short presentation with the dragon guy from Mulan. They showed all the concepts they came up with until they reached the final design. Afterward, there were drawing activities for kids.  

<strong>The Great Movie Ride</strong>
This ride took you through the history of motion pictures. It wasn't that exciting or interesting. The coolest part about it was seeing the Raiders of the Lost Ark trailer while waiting in line.

All in all is was a great rain-free day. We even got some pictures taken with Power Rangers.
