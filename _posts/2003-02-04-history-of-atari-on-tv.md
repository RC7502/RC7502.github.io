One of my new cable channels is <a href=http://www.g4tv.com>G4</a>, a 24 hour video game channel. Last night they had a show on the history of Atari. It was pretty interesting. Since it was only a half hour show they breezed through the 90s though. If you have the G4 network I recommend checking it out since they'll probably show it again.
