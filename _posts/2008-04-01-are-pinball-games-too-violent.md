But is it too violent for children? According to a new study by Oxford University's phrenology department, pinball could trigger the "crazy centers" of a child's brain. "When that metal ball does all that banging around it causes unwanted excitement in a child which could make them violent to others." says Dr. Buzz Killington. He adds, "Children should not be wasting their time with these entertainments when they could be learning a trade."
