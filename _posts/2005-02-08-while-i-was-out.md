Just in case you were wondering <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=444>this is why there hasn't been a comic.</a> Today's comic features special guest stars <a href=http://www.geocities.com/rogerdevo/>The Raj</a> and <a href=http://rantswithpants.8m.com/>Heather.</a> I'll let you figure out which is which. <br />

Now that the novelty has worn off I have gone back to World of Warcraft. Brad and I have just created new characters on the server BloodHoof. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20050208.png' alt'' />
