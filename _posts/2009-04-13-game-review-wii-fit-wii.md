However, unlike 70% of the people who bought it, I plan on actually using it. I've been doing it for a week now and here are my results so far. When I started the game the first time it reminded me a lot of Brain Age for the DS. There is a test each day, exercises to do and new exercises to unlock. I have no problem unlocking things because it keeps me motivated. My first complaint is that the exercises are way to easy at the beginning. It would have been nice if you could pick a base fitness level to start with. I run marathons so doing just 8 reps of a strength exercise isn't going to do much. It would also be nice to do full routines with multiple exercises, multiple sets, without going in and picking each one individually. If you are training with a partner it would be nice to switch off without exiting back to the main menu every time. I'm sure they'll address this in the sequel. Here are how the exercises break down:

<strong>Yoga
</strong>The Yoga poses are kind of hard. I'm not very flexible and holding a certain pose for a long time really stretches my muscles.

<strong>Strength Training
</strong>These are the hardest ones and probably the most beneficial, push-ups especially.

<strong>Aerobics
</strong>The hula hoop and the step game are fun but running in place makes me feel like an idiot.

<strong>Balance Games
</strong>I am sure there is very little fitness benefit to these, but they are a fun break from the real exercises. I like the skiing the best.

All in all, I don't think the Wii Fit by itself is going to help anyone lose ton of weight. I still watch my diet, lift weights and run in addition to Wii Fit. What it does do though is track your progress in a fun way and it burns more calories than sitting on the couch. I look forward to new fitness games that use the balance board but the Wii Fit game itself I give a B-.
