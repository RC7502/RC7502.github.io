I tried out Netflix for awhile last December when I had picked up an HD-DVD player and wanted to see how good movies looked on it. When the format died I canceled my subscription. My complaints were not only HD-DVD going away but that there was no way to stream video to the Mac. A year later and not only can you stream video to the Mac, but an XBOX 360 as well!

Setting up Netflix on the 360 only took a couple minutes. you have to take a confirmation code form the 360 and enter it on your computer so it's nice to have a laptop nearby. Once you have Netflix set up it will only show you the items in your Watch Instantly queue. It would have been nice to be able to see the entire library on the 360 but this is a minor complaint. Therefore, you have to add items to your queue on a computer before they'll show up on the 360. When you add a season of TV show to your instant queue you have the option of watching any episode from that season. After you start a TV show or movie it takes about 20-30 seconds to load. It scales the quality of the video to the speed of your network connection. While watching videos I have only had the video stutter one time and it was an HD episode of 30 Rock. After it rebuffered it didn't stall again the rest of the episode. During video playback if you fast forward or rewind the screen will put up still frames until you see the part you want to resume. There is a little buffering time after a fast forward or rewind. Pausing and resuming is instantaneous though.

My favorite feature is that if you stop a video it will show you the percentage completed so you can resume later. This is excellent for TV shows because you can easily see which episode you watched last. Another nice thing is that new episodes of Heroes are up on Netflix the day after they air so you can watch without commercials. I don't know if there are any other shows they do that for. Overall, I am very impressesd with how flawlessly Netflix runs on the 360. If you have a 360 and like watching movies I definitely recommend trying out the $9 a month Netflix plan.
