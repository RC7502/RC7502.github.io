I had just got an NES and that was still what most of my friends were playing. Eventually one of my friends did get a Genesis and we took turns playing Sonic the Hedgehog all night. It was a pretty amazing game for the time period. It had better graphics and moved faster than any game we'd seen before. 

Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform game where you can turn into a ball and roll quickly through the level. The controls are simple, move and jump. Once you get through the first area the game turns into more of a traditional platformer. There's not a lot of room to go fast. By the fourth level you're underwater and that really slows you down. Although this game is revolutionary, Sega didn't get everything right the first time. They added the spin dash and multiplayer in the second game (which is in my opinion they greatest Sonic game ever created). 

Chances are if you have a Genesis you already have this game. If not, I recommend firing up an emulator and taking a trip down memory lane. Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the great classics in video game history.
