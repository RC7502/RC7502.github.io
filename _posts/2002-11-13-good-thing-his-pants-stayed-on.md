The idea for <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=79>today's comic</a> came from <a href=user.php?op=userinfo&uname=CowboySpike1624>CowboySpike1624.</a> <br />
<br />
Remember, you can send your own comics or comic ideas to <a href=mailto:comics@bitsmack.com>comics@bitsmack.com</a>. I take the good ideas and turn them into comics. The bad ideas I send to ABC so that they can turn them into crappy sitcoms.
