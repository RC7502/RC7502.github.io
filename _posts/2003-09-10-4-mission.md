So I picked up Final Fantasy Tactics Advance just so I wouldn't feel left out when everyone is linking up with this game. I haven't "linked up" in quite a while. Really this is only the second game I've bought since I joined Gamefly a couple months ago. I'm disappointed that FFTA doesn't have Auto Battle and Fitting Room like the original. Basically I just want a game that will play by itself. Maybe I need to borrow Xenosaga from K-Dog.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030910.gif' alt'' />
