All of the hype for this new Star Trek movie is justified. It is very good. I think both Trek fans and non-Trek fans should be able to enjoy it. I'm going to list off my likes and dislikes and it will be pretty spoiler heavy so be warned.

<strong>Kirk's Origin
</strong>I didn't know anything about Kirk's dad going into this movie. That didn't matter since he was killed by time travel anyway. Kid Kirk pisses off his step-dad by driving his classic car off a cliff. Gozar brought up the point, "how many canyons do they have in Iowa?" Captain Pike shows up and invites him to join Starfleet.

<strong>Three Years Later</strong>
In Star Trek II it was mentioned that Kirk was the only person to beat the Kobayashi Maru test, because he cheated. Now we finally get to see him do it and it was probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie. This is when Chris Pine's Kirk was probably the most like William Shatner. Things get interrupted when Starfleet gets a distress call and the entire fleet is sent in to investigate. It'd be like if a British fishing boat sent out an S.O.S. and the US sent every Navy vessel in the fleet to offer assistance.

<strong>Vulcan Has Seen Better Days
</strong>The Romulan ship using their Black Hole Strawberry Jam of Doom destroys the planet Vulcan, killing Spock's mom. At this point, since time travel had already been introduced I assumed they would go back in time to prevent this. Going back in time to stop bad things made up like 10% of all Star Trek Voyager episodes.

<strong>Chain of Command
</strong>Spock is in charge of the ship and he wants to go get killed with the rest of the fleet. Kirk wants to attack the ship directly arguing that since the Romulans are from the future they know what happens and if the Enterprise does something totally insane they won't see it coming. I don't know what kind of logic that is, but then again Kirk's not the logical one. Spock does the rational thing and kicks Kirk off the ship in an escape pod. Apparently, this Enterprise doesn't have a brig or the ability to confine someone to quarters.

After landing on Hoth, Kirk gets chased by the Cloverfield monster and runs into old Spock, who just happened to be there. Conveinent! They go to an outpost and find Scotty living there with an Oompa Loompa. Scotty and Kirk beam into a Snapple bottling plant that's located in the Enterprise's engine room. Scotty is stuck in one of the large people-sized tubes but luckily Kirk hit the "dump crap into the center of the room" switch at the last possible moment.

<strong>Final Battle
</strong>Kirk takes control of the ship and they attack the Romulan ship. After playing cowboys and indians for a little while Spock detonates the remaining Doom Jam which destroys the Romulan ship and the Enterprise barely makes it out in one piece. They weren't able to turn things back to the way they were.

At this point Kirk's dad is still dead, Vulcan is still destroyed and old Spock gets to live out the rest of his days in an alternate universe. On the one hand you could say that four TV series and ten movies now no longer exist, but on the other hand they are now able to do anything they want in future Star Trek movies without having to worry about continuity.

I thought the movie was excellent. It had a great momentum, lots of action and special effects, and a very good cast. All your favorite Star Trek catch phrases pop up at some point in time. I thought Bones sounded the most like the original, but the guy that played Chekov had too thick of an accent.

Whether or not you are a Star Trek fan, if you watch movies you should see this one. I find it hard to believe anything is going to beat this this summer.
