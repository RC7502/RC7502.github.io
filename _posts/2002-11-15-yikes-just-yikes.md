I let Keaton do <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=80>today's comic.</a> <br />
<br />
Now you may not understand what is going on in the comic, I know I didn't at first. Let's see if we can figure this out together. In the first panel we see kruton and I having our usual witty banter. The second panel looks like kruton doing his impression of the Home Alone kid. Now the third panel is tricky, it looks like Vice City has sprouted some kind of arms made out licorice. Kruton says he knows what he must do, maybe he is going to eat the licorice, I'm not sure. I hope this clears things up.
<br />
<br />
In other news, kruton finally let me borrow Vice City so I can see what all the hype is about. I need something to hold me over until Metroid.

Oh and last night was ACM game night. Age of Mythology is a pretty cool game.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021115.gif' alt'' />
