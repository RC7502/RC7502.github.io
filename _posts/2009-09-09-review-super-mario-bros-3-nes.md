It added the overworld map, flying and item inventory to the original Super Mario Bros. That being said I found the game more frustrating than fun. It's all about trial and error to get through a level and once you're finally through it if you lose all your lives you have to go through it again. There is a continue feature which is nice so I don't have to start all the way over. One could argue that every Mario game is trial and error and I played through some difficult levels in Super Mario Galaxy many many times, but at least in newer games if you get stuck on something you can go complete other levels and come back to it. 

Super Mario Bros 3 should be in your collection if you are a Mario fan or love side scrolling platformers, but it just couldn't draw me in.
