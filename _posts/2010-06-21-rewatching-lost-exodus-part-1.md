Here we go. Part 1 of the first season finale. Michael and Walt are in a hotel room watching Power Rangers. Then back on the island the French woman rolls into town. 

On the island: Jack's gang heads to the black rock for dynamite, Michael's group gets the raft ready.
Off the island: We see all of the main cast in the time before they board the plane. 

Danielle talks about how when she arrived on the island she only got to be with her child a week before The Others took her. I do have to say they built one heck of a boat in the amount of time they've been there. It blows away Tom Hanks's in Cast Away. We get a scene in the airport with Ana Lucia. This is where we also find out Jack is no longer married. We don't know if she died or they got a divorce yet. We also get to see Sawyer back at the police station like he was in Boone's flashback. Sawyer tells Jack he met his dad in a bar. Danielle mentioned an area where a guy lost his arm.
