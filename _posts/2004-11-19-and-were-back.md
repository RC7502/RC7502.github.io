If it's not broke why fix it? I decided to abandon my redesigned Bitsmack for now and kick it old school. The reviews are back and the comics will be coming back on a semi-regular basis. I know I've probably lost a lot of readers but tell your friends and get the word out that Bitsmack is back with a vengance!
