Ahhhh, it's been 5 days since I met Dan, the biggest Bemani freak I've ever met and I miss playing Bemani games with him :( Oh well, I'll be strong until I can get a set like his for myself. So the big tournament is coming up this Saturday in Findlay and I hope you can all make it out to see the big battle.

Props to the fallen as our very own DDRMe{DevilZukin} (CowboySpike1624) will not be able to attend this tourney. RC better bring the DDRME cam so we can get footage of this tourney as it happens. I'm sooo looking forward to this all!!! Hope to see you all lata
