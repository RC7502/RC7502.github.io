Am I the only one who has put one and one together and made two? Rick Rolling started right after the Family Guy episode where Brian sings, <em><strong>Never Gonna Give You Up</strong></em> in the <em>Back to the Future</em> spoof episode.

The same thing happened with Journey and <em><strong>Don't Stop Believing</strong></em>. I noticed students listening to Journey at school!

I don't believe that Family Guy is getting the credit it deserves for starting these Internet memes.

Am I way off base?
