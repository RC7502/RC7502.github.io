The Revolution controller has been announced. I don't know how I feel about this.

I saw <a href=http://cube.ign.com/articles/651/651334p1.html>the video</a> and I am still stunned. Is this the worst idea Nintendo ever had or will it provide a new gameplay experience unlike any other? Please someone tell me how I am supposed to feel about this thing.
