I read a handful of web comics every week. All of them are much better than my own. One of those comics is <a href="http://cad-comic.com/">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a>. It is usually funny on one shot comics but I don't really get into the multipart storylines. Lately, though I've been having deja vu when reading it. Check out these two comics:

<a href="http://cad-comic.com/comic.php?d=2007-08-31">http://cad-comic.com/comic.php?d=2007-08-31</a> 8/31/2007

Not exactly the same joke, and they were both out the same day, so just chalk that up to coincidence. Now look at these two:

<a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/03/28">http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/03/28</a> 3/28/2007
<a href="http://cad-comic.com/comic.php?d=2007-07-18">http://cad-comic.com/comic.php?d=2007-07-18</a> 7/18/2007

These two are much closer to the same joke, and the Ctrl+Alt+Del one comes three months later. So what? It's not really a big deal. When you are doing web comics about video games you're bound to have overlap talking about the same games. I wouldn't even draw attention to it until I saw this:

<a href="http://cad-comic.com/comic.php?d=2007-09-14">http://cad-comic.com/comic.php?d=2007-09-14</a> 9/14/2007
<a href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2005/05/16/product-tie-ins/">http://bitsmack.com/comics/2005/05/16/product-tie-ins/</a> 5/16/2005

That bastard ripped off a comic I made two years ago! He just swapped in Halo 3 for Star Wars. Rationally speaking I'm sure Tim Buckley has never read my comic, but irrationally speaking this is blatant plagiarism!
