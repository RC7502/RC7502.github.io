Yes, its that time again... anime night! I'm hosting it again this time, at my place in Findlay, so hopefully more people will be able to stop by for a night of nerdiness and fun! (and maybe this time I'll actually be able to have some snacks and sodas!) <p>
<br />
I call it a kind of, pre-Ikasucon party, since Anime  Matt and I are going to Cinci the next day to cosplay at the convention.  Anyone else who wants to come is more than welcome to follow us down there or hitch a ride!
<br />
The party will follow the DDR lock-in, to those who are going to that too. To anyone else, the party starts when you get here!!! (^^) (err, around 7pm or so) <p>
<br />
There's not a set theme yet- maybe some Trigun if RC gets it and a mixture of whatever anyone else wants to bring.  The next volume of Azumanga Diaoh comes out soon so maybe we'll watch that next time.  I also have some anime on my computer, as well as some AMVs.  Oh, and if anyone's not already tired of beat games, I'll have DDR as well as Karaoke Revolution again.<p>
<br />
If you need directions, or have any suggestions, let me know!
