Where was I going with <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=438>this?</a><br />

I don't think I have been playing World of Warcraft long enough to be considered an addict by clinical definition. However, I do play it from the time I get home from work until time for bed only stopping for supper. There's just so much to do in this game its always "let's finish one more quest" or "I need to get to the next level" followed by "what new powers can I get on this level?" If you have a social life and always on the go I don't suggest this game. But if you have a lot of time on your hands and want that time to go by lightning fast by all means pick this one up. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20050104.png'   />
