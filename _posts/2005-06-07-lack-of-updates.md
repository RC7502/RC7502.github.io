Sorry there has been a lack of updates lately. This week I am out of town getting my last client to go live. Once they go live I won't have any more implementations until we sell another system. My motivation to do a comic comes and goes. Lately it has just been too nice outside to be indoors hunched over my computer. I haven't even been playing Warcraft. Stay tuned next week for a comic hopefully.
