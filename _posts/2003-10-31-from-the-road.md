You would think I would do a Halloween comic today, <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=350>wrong!</a>
<br />

<br />
I've been in Cincinnati for the last couple of days and its hard to do a comic when I don't have access to my computer. Anyway, it really isn't Halloween until I leave my client (aka Satan) and head back to Columbus for some Devryguyz party action.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20031031.gif' alt'' />
