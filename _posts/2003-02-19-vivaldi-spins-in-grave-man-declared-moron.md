Occasionally I check out the DDRFreak website. I came across this funny <a href=http://www.ddrfreak.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=54634>post.</a>

To give you some background there is a techno song in the game Beatmania called "V" that gets its melody from Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Last night on Joe Millionare they played part of this classical piece. A guy posted in the forums asking if anyone heard this new "all violin" version of V. It made me wonder just how much classical music will only be remembered for the commerical it was used in.
