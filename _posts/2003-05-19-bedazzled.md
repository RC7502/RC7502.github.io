Ever since the release of the iMac, I've admired Apple from afar. They are great for video and image editing, not to mention they just look cool. Up until now I've been waiting for just one more reason to push me over the edge into the world of Macintosh. Last night I got that reason...
<br />

<br />
I see a commercial with a guy badly singing the early 90s favorite "Baby's got back." I was unsure at first if what I was seeing was a commercial or in fact someone's embarassing home movies had made it to air. One minute before eternity the commercial ends and I am informed that I can buy music for $.99 from Apple. This is what I've been waiting for my whole life, a guy badly singing "Baby's got back." Apple is a company I want to work with. You don't see anyone badly singing "Baby's got back" on a Gateway or Dell commerical. It is further proof of Apple's commitment to innovation.
<br />

<br />
After the commercial, but before I am able to click "Checkout" at the Apple Store, my excitement starts to wane. Maybe I was too dazzled by the idea of a guy badly singing "Baby's got back" to make a serious computer purchase. I removed the dual G4 from my shopping cart and stepped away from the computer. Minutes later as I've returned to the television I am introduced to a little kid badly singing "The Real Slim Shady." 
<br />

<br />
As I sprinted back to my computer, the Earth exploded.
