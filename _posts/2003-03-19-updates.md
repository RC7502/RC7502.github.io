If you've never heard of RSS, it's a way to grab news headlines from various websites. You can put these headlines on your site or there is a newsreader called <a href=http://www.wildgrape.net/>NewsDesk</a> that can grab RSS headlines and stories. There is a link on the left side if you want to use the Bitsmack RSS feed.

I also cleaned up the <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=newestreviews>Newsest Reviews</a> page.

Here's a <a href=http://www.devryguyz.com/new/ep039.php>comic</a> from the DevryGuyz that mentions Bitsmack. I also don't think <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=2917>Conker's Bad Fur Day</a> deserves to be a 10.
