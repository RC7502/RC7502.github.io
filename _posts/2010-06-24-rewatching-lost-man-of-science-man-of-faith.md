Here we go, first episode of Season 2. We open on some guy going about his day. Seeing this the first time I assumed this was somebodies flashback. Then the bomb goes off and we find out there's a guy living in this hatch. 

On the island: Jack thinks Locke is crazy for having faith there is something important down the hatch.
Off the island: Jack thinks his dad is crazy for giving people hope before going into surgery. 

There's a weird scene where Shannon is looking for Vincent and Walt appears soaking wet and whispering something. I don't think this ever gets explained. It can't be the smoke monster because he can only appear as dead people. We get to see Desmond for the first time when him and Jack are running at the stadium. Apparently major stadiums are open at any time for people to run stairs. Desmond is training for a race around the world. We also get to see how Jack saved the woman that he married later on.
