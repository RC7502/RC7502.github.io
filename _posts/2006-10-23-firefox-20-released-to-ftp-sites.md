Fire up your browser and head on over to <a href='http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0/'>Mozilla's ftp mirrors</a> to download the latest version of Firefox. Although this version isn't as monumental as those in the past, it does add a couple of nice features, including spell check in form fields and a built in session manager to restore your browser windows and tabs after you quit or if it crashes.
