I'm too busy enjoying my day off to put up a new comic so check back Wednesday and Friday.
<br />

<br />
I rented the Pulp Fiction Special Edition DVD. I forgot how great that movie is. The Special Edition has all the typical bonus features like behind the scenes footage, cast interviews and deleted scenes. I was disappointed there wasn't a director's commentary, instead there is a "trivia track" which puts interesting facts about the movie in subtitles at the bottom of the screen.

I also listened to SNL star Jimmy Fallon's comedy CD this weekend. Even though I am a big fan of his work on Saturday Night Live, this CD is lame. The first four songs aren't funny at all, they're just songs, and not even good songs. Then the rest of the album is stand-up comedy about college life. I thought this was funny but it was way too short, at only about 10 min long. If you are looking for a really good comedy CD listen to Adam Sandler's first two CDs instead.
