I remember seeing the Dreamcast demo display in a Toys 'R Us but wasn't really impressed with it at first. At that time I was a big fan of the Nintendo 64 and Sega had already failed with the Sega CD, 32X and Saturn. I saw Sonic Adventure and thought the game lost all its speed and thrill by being in 3D.

I didn't get a Dreamcast until 2 years later when it dropped to $99. By that time there were many great games for it. I spent a lot of time with Tony Hawk 2, Crazy Taxi 1 & 2, Worms, Soul Calibur and Virtua Tennis. The first time I ever played Dance Dance Revolution was on a Dreamcast version we pirated.

The Dreamcast was a good system to fill in the time between the N64 and the PS2. Most of its classic games can now be found on other systems. What are some of your favorite Dreamcast memories?
