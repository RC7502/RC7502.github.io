Yeah, no comic today. Between Brad and Will moving in and season finales I haven't had time. I have decided however that once all my favorite shows have had their finales I'm not going to watch any TV all summer, except while I'm eating. This should give me more time to get my various projects done and get comics done on a regular basis.
