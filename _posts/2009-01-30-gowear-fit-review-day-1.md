I wore the GoWear Fit to bed last night and surprisingly enough I couldn't even tell I was wearing it. It said last night I was lying down for 7:41, but only really asleep for 4:21, giving me a sleep efficiency of 57%. I have no idea what a normal sleep efficiency is, and I couldn't find anything on the GoWear Fit site to tell me how to interpret these numbers.

I ran three miles first thing in the morning at about 10 min/mile and then walked for 15 min. The GoWear Fit said I burned 371 calories. I also use a site called <a href="http://www.runningahead.com/">Running Ahead</a> to track my running and biking workouts. It said I burned 356 running. The Daily Plate said I burned 45 walking, for a total of 401. Yes, I am currently using three separate web sites to track my workouts and diet (I won't even bring up the spreadsheets I also use).

Totals for the day

GoWear Fit
Avg. Calories Consumed: 1800
Calories Burned: 2261
Result: Under by 461

The Daily Plate
Calorie Goal: 1191
Calories Consumed: 1670
Calories Burned by Exercise: 401
Net Calories: 1269
Result: Over by 78

At this point I think I've figured out what to do. Since the diet tracking in the GoWear software is kinda crappy, I'm going to use the calories burned from GoWear and calories burned from The Daily Plate. If the difference of those two numbers is between 500-1000 I should lose 1-2 pounds a week.
