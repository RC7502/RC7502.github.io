Being an anti-social hermit, I don't get out much.  I have no friends and no life, so it shouldn't surprise anybody that I am totally clueless about things like the Xbox 360, The Colbert Report, or Posh Spice.

But, I do manage to venture forth from my lair on rare occasions, and I did so on Monday night.  It was worth it, because I spotted my first iPhone in the wild.

I didn't actually see the screen, but I saw the owner typing (slowly) on its surface, and she rotated it back and forth a few times during use.

Damn, but that thing is small.  Sweet.  Hot.  The Bomb.  Awesome.  EleventyOne111!!!!!

Question for the Bitsmack audience: Will I burn in hell for having unclean sexual thoughts about a consumer electronics device?
