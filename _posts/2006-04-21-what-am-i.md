Here's the quote of the day when I was checking my Gmail:

<a onclick="return top.js._AD_GoTo(window,event,this,1,'fr','6405517509031307174','5')" class="lc" target="_blank" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/r/ralph_waldo_emerson.html">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a><span class="g"> - "A man is what he thinks about all day long."</span>

Does that mean I am a hot chick? That doesn't even make sense. "Nature" my ass Emerson.
