After finishing <a href="http://bitsmack.com/wp/2009/06/24/the-value-of-life-in-the-transfomers-universe/">my last post</a> I had some more questions that came up. There are more spoilers for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen so be warned.

The Decepticons' main motivation in this movie was to find a machine that can destroy a sun and turn it into Energon, the Transformers main source of power. There is a scene where Starscream shows a dead baby Decepticon and saying they don't have enough Energon to keep their children alive. This makes the Decepticons' cause much more sympathetic. They're not trying to destroy the sun to kill all the humans, they're just trying to survive. They literally want to steal a sun to feed a starving family. 

On the Autobots side we never once hear one complain about not having enough Energon. Where are the Autobots getting it? The only assumptions I can make are that the Autobots have the technology to create Energon without using a sun or they have found an alternative power source so that they don't need Energon. In either case, why has no one offered to share this information with the Decepticons in exchange for peace? Has Optimus Prime ever suggested a cease fire to work out their problems diplomatically? The Decepticons want their revenge because the Autobots are withholding life saving information and <a href="http://bitsmack.com/wp/2009/06/24/the-value-of-life-in-the-transfomers-universe/">killing their people on sight. </a>

One could argue that the Decepticons are evil and even if their Energon supply was good they would still attempt to conquer Earth, but there's no way to know that for sure until peace talks have at least been attempted. From this perspective what the Autobots are doing to the Decepticons is genocide. Optimus Prime claims to be "protecting humans" but what he is really doing is hunting down and exterminating the Decepticon race.
