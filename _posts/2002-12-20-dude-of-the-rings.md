<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=94>Today's comic</a> is NOT on my Christmas list. 
<br />
<br />
Video games that are based on movies have a really bad track record. There are some exceptions (Empire Strikes Back 2600, Goldeneye N64), but for the most part they suck. Despite this history of sucking these movie based games still get released. It's gotten to the point now that they can release more than one game per movie, LucasArts being the most notable offender (here is where I would list ALL the games released for SW:Episode 1, but I think you get the idea). Even though in the comic I mention LOTR (Lord of the Rings for the acronymly impaired), I hear The Two Towers game is actually pretty good. 
<br />
<br />
Speaking of The Two Towers (see that transition, pure genius), Goz, K-Dog and I got to see the movie opening night. I thought it was much better than the first one. Since the focus kept changing from one group to another I never got bored with any of the 3 storylines going on at once. This movie gets my thumbs up.
<br />
<br />
In other news I am still trying to coerce K-Dog into posting on Bitsmack. This time it invloved a steel bear trap and a can of Caffeine Free Mountain Dew. I don't think he even noticed he stepped in the trap so he's probably still got that thing attached to his leg... wherever he is.

<b>Afterthoughts:</b>
<br />
Today is my last day at Microsoft. I sure will miss answering phones... NOT. 
<br />
<br />
I have also added a new section to the right side. For those of you who can't get enough of Goz (and who can really), you can now read articles from his site www.ryancollins.org.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20021220.gif' alt'' />
