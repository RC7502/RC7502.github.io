This site is one of the Simpsons topp 100. It is a map of Springfield using The Simpsons episodes to reference one place to another created by students at Pomona. Very cool; it downloads as a PDF. If you like and know the Simpsons, then see if you agree with where Moe's is. http://www.mapofspringfield.com/
