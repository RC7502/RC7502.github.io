<b>DVD Review: An Evening with Kevin Smith</b>
<br />
An Evening with Kevin Smith is a 2 disc DVD set that shows highlights of Q&A sessions Kevin Smith did at 5 or 6 different college campuses. Even though he plays Silent Bob in the movies Smith rarely gives a short answer in these sessions. His longer stories were obviously prepared ahead of time but he is absolutely hilarious in the way he tells them. He says he can't act but his comic timing is excellent. I am a die hard Kevin Smith fan but about 90% of his stories were things I've never heard. Some of these stories include:
<br />
<br />
- working on a script for a Superman movie 
<br />
- joining Dogma protesters outside a theater
<br />
- his feud with Tim Burton
<br />
- making a documentary for Prince
<br />
<br />
The feature is about 3 hours long on 2 discs but I still felt like it was ending too soon. I actually hurt I was laughing so loud. My only minor complaint is that there are no special features whatsoever. I don't really know what they could have included anyway. 
<br />
<br />
I rate DVDs 3 ways: Don't watch it, rent it, or buy it. If you are a big Kevin Smith fan like me you'll probably buy it. However if you don't need it for your collection you may want to rent it because it doesn't have any extra features to keep you coming back.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030101.gif' alt'' />
