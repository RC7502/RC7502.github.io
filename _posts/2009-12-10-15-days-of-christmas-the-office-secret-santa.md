It's Christmas Time once again at Dunder Mifflin. Andy is giving Erin the 12 days of Christmas which means a lot of bird problems. Phyllis and Michael are fighting over who gets to be Santa, and Oscar has crush on one of the warehouse workers.  

Listen, it's The Office. There's too much awesome stuff to list here. Just go watch the show for a good laugh.
