Well I'm back for a short message.<br />
<a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116290">The top 50 most important games</a> according to <a href="http://www.1up.com/">1up</a> was released.  It includes many old and new games including <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3124081">ET</a>, <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3127691"> Super Mario Bros.</a>, and even <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3133882">Gauntlet</a> made the cut.<br />
<br />
My life:<br />
Lately it's all about <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">WoW</a>.  Servers were going down hard last night so I'm currently residing on <A href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/serverstatus/">Bloodhoof </a>as Aliiance and just started on <A href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/serverstatus/">Spinebreaker </a>as Horde.<br />
<br />
I bought a <a href="http://www.slickdeals.net/?pno=5778&lno=4&afsrc=1">Dell 20" Wide flat panel monitor.</a>  Some says it's a little excessive, I say it's about time!<br />
<br />
Other than that my phone is getting fixed, and so is my laptop so I get to take any computers I can.  As a little FYI I don't recommend the Treo 600 to ANYONE anymore.  The phone as well as Sprint have caused me much heartache in the last couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
See you all later,<br />
K-dog out!
