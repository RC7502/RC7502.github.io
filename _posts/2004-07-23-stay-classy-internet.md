Brad, Cassadi and I went to Easton last night for some gaming and a movie. Gameworks got a whole bunch of new games since the last time I was there like Outrun 2, Star Wars Starfighter, and this weird horse racing game where you save your horses on cards and keep coming back and training them and stuff. It looked really cool but it's expensive and I still have no idea how the game is played. Gameworks does continue its legacy of being the worst place to play DDR. On the Extreme machine the left side arrows don't work and the music might as well be turned off completely it's so low. It was strange though that you can't fail the first stage and you get 5 songs instead of 3.

After Gameworks and a little shopping we went and saw Anchorman, starring Will Ferrell. I thought the movie was awesome. There were so many good one liners I need to go see it again. Ferrell was of course hilarious, but the supporting cast like Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell were funny as well. There were also a lot of really good cameo appearances. The movie does get silly at times, but I thought they went through a lot of effort to capture the look of the 70s. Overall, Anchorman was a good time and I look forward to watching it again when it comes out on DVD.

<b>Afterthought</b>

Here's an interesting <a href=http://www.pitch.com/issues/2004-03-18/feature.html/1/index.html>article</a> on DDR culture. Oh, did I say interesting, I meant lame. Basically it is about this loser that steals from arcades, gets kicked out of school and fired from several jobs, but yet he's supposed to be a rock star because he's good at DDR. It makes the generalization that people who play DDR are goth, punk, social outcasts that have nothing else going for them but a video game.

You know you are in for some good upcoming movies when you see not one, but two trailers for movies with Matthew Lillard.
