<strong>Resurrection Man</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Every time this guy dies he comes back to life with a new super power somehow tied to how he died.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Yes, I liked this one a lot. 

<strong>Savage Hawkman</strong><br>
What I think is going on: A guy doesn't want to be Hawkman and burns his armor. The armor is like "screw you, I'm going to make you Hawkman even harder" <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. Not very interesting. 

<strong>Static Shock</strong><br>
What I think is going on: I've heard this is supposed to be the DC version of Spider-Man <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. I don't really understand his powers. 

<strong>Stormwatch</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Martian Manhunter and a couple other guys form like a space Justice League.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Yes. I read that Apollo and Midnighter were brought in from another comic label and I want to see where they go with it.

<strong>Suicide Squad</strong><br>
What I think is going on: The first rule of this terrible Thunderbolts knockoff is that you don't talk about this terrible Thunderbolts knockoff. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No, even though it does have Harley Quinn. 

<strong>Superboy</strong><br>
What I think is going on: They've grown a Superman clone in a tube who totally strolls by people in danger. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Yes. It was a good introduction issue. 

<strong>Supergirl</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Supergirl arrives to Earth. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Yeah. I need to read a few more issues before I can pass judgement. 

<strong>Superman</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Superman fights a fire monster for short periods of time in between boring dialogue. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. Every time I started to get into the action the page would turn and there would be a dense piece of dialogue with Lois at the Daily Planet. If I want to read about Superman I'll stick with Action Comics instead. 

<strong>Swamp Thing</strong><br>
What I think is going on: A guy is Swamp Thing or something, I don't remember a lot. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. I've always heard how great Swamp Thing is but this comic was boring.

<strong>Teen Titans</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Teenage superheroes are being hunted. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Yes, this was one of my favorite ones. I loved that Kid Flash tries to stop a fire and ends up making it worse. I also like that there are 4 different Robins now so it makes sense that 2 could be in teams. Contrast that with Marvel where there is 1 Wolverine but he is in a dozen different teams. 

<strong>Voodoo</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Aliens travel millions of miles to work in our strip clubs. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. Not even pages and pages of near nudity can trick me into reading.

<strong>Wonder Woman</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Wonder Woman is part of Greek mythology now? <br>
Will I keep reading it: Nope. I've never been a fan of Wonder Woman.

That's it for my reviews. Here are my final results:

Comics I'll definitely keep reading: Action Comics, Batman, Flash, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, Green Lantern New Guardians, Justice League Dark, Justice League, Nightwing, Resurrection Man, Stormwatch, Superboy, Supergirl, Teen Titans
