UGH! School's back in session for me and RC now!! I think we both had a great last weekend! From Partying in Columbus Friday with Goz and RC at the Apple Store and Gameworks to the awesome Krutch and Relient K concert on Saturday!! (Man the pit really beat me up! :) ) Now I'm back in the dorms and all I really have setup is my PC.

Work is becomming a whole other story with Arena daze @ ITS from 8-8, working @ TLTC and going to class while trying to do my bi-daily post and have a lil bit of fun this year. Well I hope you all have fun reading this, my new site might actually get developed now that I am taking a Web Dev class here at the University!
