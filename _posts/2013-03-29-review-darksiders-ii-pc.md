Screw this game. I really tried to give it a chance but no, screw this game. Ok wait, let's back up to the beginning.

Awhile back, THQ went under and all their digital games got bundled up and discounted. You could pick up all their games in a Humble Bundle for pay what you want pricing. Then a couple weeks later Amazon added some games and sold the bundle for $25. A month after that THQ would pay you $5 to download their games. 

I have no idea why I picked Darksiders II to play right away. I didn't play the first one. I guess my logic was that the first one must have been good to warrant a sequel. That's how sequels work right? Anyway, it starts out reminding me a lot of God of War, which I really liked. There's great action, plus a good equipment upgrade system. 

Where this game finally lost me was only a couple levels in. There was this part where I needed get across this chasm and I couldn't figure out how to do it. I looked around for awhile before I finally gave up and looked up a walkthrough video on YouTube. This takes time out of my already limited video game time, because you have to skip around these videos to find the part you are stuck on. Looking something up one time isn't a dealbreaker for me. I kept playing and not 10 minutes later I got stuck on another part. There is this part where you roll a ball into a divot and something happens. Then you have to use a bomb to dislodge the ball and move it to another divot. Throwing the bomb was already difficult because there is no way to aim with the XBOX controller. When I finally hit the ball it still wouldn't let me move it. If I got close the red "B" button would appear with the word "Roll". But when I pressed B nothing would happen. It definitely seemed bugged to me. 

At this point I gave up on the game. If I have to do research online twice in an hour to play your game, there is a major failure in that game. The only goal in playing video games is to have fun and this one was not fun, just frustrating. With literally hundreds of new games coming out every year I can't recommend this one. Go play something better.
