<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=53>Today's comic</a> is part of a complete breakfast.

Not much has been going this week except for me playing Super Monkey Ball until the cows come home. Then I go outside and say "Hey cows! Get out of my yard." After that I realize I don't have a yard because I live in an apartment. Beginner and Advanced difficulty are so easy I practically had them beat just by turning on the Gamecube. Playing the game on Expert though is like paying someone to kick you in the crotch repeatedly. However, it's all worth it when you get through a hard level on your millionth try. This isn't my official review though, just my first impressions.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20020918.gif' alt'' />
