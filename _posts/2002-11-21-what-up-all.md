Well hello everyone.
<br />
I've started my new quest through the mythological journey of Age of Mythologies, where I fend off mythological creatures, brave hero's against the power of the gods and defeat the evil C++ program master, Prof. Gunnet.
<br />

<br />
But anyway, I'm mainly juggling work, class and AoM as I wait for my next adventure through the great Beamani collection.
<br />
Remember Bitsmackers, RC and I will be appearing at the Defiance mall's "Pocket Change" arcade, at the Para Para Paradise machine this Saturday from around 11am-4pm (unless we get bored sooner than that) Other than that I've got nothing more to say.
<br />

<br />
lata,
<br />
K-dog
