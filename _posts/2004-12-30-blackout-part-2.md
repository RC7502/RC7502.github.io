Here's <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=437>part 2</a> of our ongoing story. I have a long rant I want to make but its late because I've been playing World of Warcraft. So maybe I'll post it in the morning.<br />
<br />
Good morning. If anyone has ever wondered why I play console games more than PC let me describe for you how I spent Tuesday night. Brad picked up two copies of World of Warcraft because I thought it was finally time to try one of these MMORPGs that are so darned popular. The game comes on four discs and I started installing about 6:30. I wish I would have timed it to see how long it took, but once I got through all four discs I had to download the latest patch. This was about 55MB and even though they use torrents it still took a long time. Even after it finished downloading it still took several minutes to install the patch. By the time I got to the point I could actually play the game it was about 9:30. But there was a catch, I still couldn't play the game. When I tried to create a character the models weren't showing up and I had all kinds of graphical crap everywhere. Since I am on a Mac I don't have to download updated video drivers because they are included in each OSX update. Luckily the next day Goz found on the forums that there was a video setting I could change that would fix the problem. So in all it took me several hours to play a game whereas on a console I just have to put in a disc. Now I know I said I was on a Mac but in the past I have had even worse problems in PC gaming. I seem to remember one game that didn't work with the most recent video drivers so I had to install old video drivers. Maybe if you have a top of the line PC you don't have as many problems with games but you still have to sit through the install and patching process. <br />
<br />
That being said World of Warcraft is a really sweet game. You can get a bunch of quests and do them in whatever order you want. You can explore pretty much anywhere. I guess the only thing I have to compare it to is City of Heroes that I played for about a week. I liked the character creation and the super hero theme of CoH but I think in the long run WoW seems like there is more to do and won't get redundant as fast.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20041230.png'   />
