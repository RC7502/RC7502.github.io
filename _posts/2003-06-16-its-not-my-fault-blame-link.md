There's no comic today for a variety of reasons. The easiest excuse is that I didn't get any sleep Friday or Saturday so I was catching up on Sunday.
<br />

<br />
Then there is the real excuse. Sunday night I felt like playing some games. I'd played a lot of rhythm games lately so I wanted something different. I put in Zelda: The Wind Waker. I worked my way through the Deku Tree level, which is a lot of fun once you get the Boomerang. After that level a series of events lead me back to the pirate ship. It is on this ship I am subjected to a punishment so cruel and unusual that the US government would be banned from inflicting it on any citizen. This "challenge" requires me to swing from one rope to another to get across a room within a time limit. It's not as much difficult as it is frustrating. You have to jump onto a rope, stop it from swinging so that you can turn to face the next rope, then start swinging again, then jump to the next rope. If you aren't perfectly in line with the next rope you're screwed. Even as I am writing this now, I think "that wasn't so bad" but after spending an hour on just the one section I have no doubt that when gamers go to hell they are forced to repeat this swinging challenge for eternity. At many times I thought about giving up, but then I knew I would never play the game again. I finally did get past it, but by that time it was late and I had neither the ambition, nor the inspiration to do a comic. Actually, I guess I could have done a comic about how much the swinging challenge sucked.

Ok, forget I said anything.
