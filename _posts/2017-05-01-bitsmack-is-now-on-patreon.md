Patreon is a website where fans can subscribe and help contribute to artists they enjoy. Basically it is like Kickstarter but on an ongoing basis. I've been doing Bitsmack for almost 15 years now basically ad/revenue free. In fact, it costs money to host the website and renew the domain name every year. I'd like to be able to cover those costs.
If you would like to help contribute to keep the webcomic running follow this link below. Subscribers get rewards such as digital books, a discussion board, livestreams and other content.

If you don't want to contribute it's totally fine too. You can continue to see the new strips every Friday like normal. The fact that anyone reads this is baffling to me. Thanks for reading!
