<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=36>Today's comic</a> is the first part of our first comic adventure. I really tried, but I could not think of a lamer title. <br /><br />A couple of weeks ago Goz picked up Gyromite for the NES for $1. That got me thinking about R.O.B. the robot for the NES. R.O.B. was this little robot that you hooked into the NES and it would play against you... I think... something like that, I've never actually seen one myself. After the NES had been out for a couple years R.O.B. disappeared off the face of the planet. Some say he went to Hollywood to pursue a film career but was turned down for the part of Number 5 in the movie <i>Short Circuit</i>. No one really knows for sure.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020812.gif'   />
