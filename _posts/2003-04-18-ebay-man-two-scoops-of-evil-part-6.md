Wait a sec, I think he's going somewhere with <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=273>this.</a>
<br />

<br />
Cool Site of the Month:
<br />
<a href=http://www.archive.org/>http://www.archive.org/</a> has a feature called the Wayback Machine that lets you look at web pages from years ago. It's so much fun to see what sites like Gamespot and Nintendo looked like back in 1997. You can have a lot of fun at this site.
<br />

<br />
One more thing, if you want to be recognized for getting your question answered on Ask Bitsmack, you have to put your name after your question. Unless of course you don't want to be recognized which is entirely possible.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030418.gif' alt'' />
