Comics? Yeah, we got <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=269>that.</a>

So I finally got to play Amplitude this weekend, but I have mixed feelings about it. Compared to Frequency they improved about 5 things and made 2 things worse. I guess that means it is better. K-Dog also got all the parts to put together his new computer. The case is a small cube that is pretty cool (not to be confused with his G4 cube, which is not that cool). Saturday, K-Dog, Goz and I worked on a new project "that which cannot be named." More details on that later.

In case you were wondering, a 20" monitor is better than a 17".<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030407.gif'   />
