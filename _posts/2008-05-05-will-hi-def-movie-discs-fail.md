<blockquote>So what does this mean for Blu-ray player vendors? Why haven't sales experienced any sort of substantial uptick without a competitor? Prices offer one clue. Blu-ray player prices were at their peak for the year in mid-March, around $400. During the holiday shopping season the average price had been closer to $300.</blockquote>
Did anyone think that once Toshiba dropped HD-DVD that the prices of Blu-ray players would become affordable?

I think the one advantage that HD-DVD had was that you could buy the movies as combo movies, with a DVD on one side and HD-DVD on the other. Toshiba messed up when they didn't require movies to only be released in combo format. I've noticed that this is a pretty big problem. A househould may have 3 or 4 DVD players throughout their house and car, but once you buy a hi-def disc you're stuck watching it only on one player. No taking it on trips, no watching in the bedroom. I have Blade Runner on HD-DVD, and can only watch it in the living room, not in my basement. :-(
