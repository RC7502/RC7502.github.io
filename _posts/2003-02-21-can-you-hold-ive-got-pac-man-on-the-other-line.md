I got a new <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=118>cell phone.</a>
<br />
<br />
Sure I've had a cell phone for a few years but the ones I've had were cheap and weren't worth carrying around because they wouldn't stay charged or I'd a lose the signal. However, since the company was paying for this new cell phone I decided to get a good one. It has a color screen, voicemail, callerid and you can download games, pictures, screensavers, ringers, all kinds of crap. 
<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to download some better games than the ones included. The first one is a demo of a car racing game that is sluggish and boring. The second is Space Invaders, but it is also slow. The third is Monkey Ball. Keep in mind I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the Gamecube version or even the Game Boy Advance version, but it still isn't that great. I think it's the fact you have to control your monkey with a button the size of a tic tac that brings this game down. I just don't think action games work well on a cell phone.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030221.gif'   />
