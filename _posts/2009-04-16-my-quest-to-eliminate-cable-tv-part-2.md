In my last article I talked about why I wanted to get rid of cable TV. Now it's time to put my plan into action. I have two TVs that we use regularly, the HDTV in the living room and a regular TV in the bedroom. I was hoping that because I live so close to Columbus I should be able to get the network channels over the air using just rabbit ears. I would also need a digital converter box, so I signed up to get the free $40 coupons from the government. Once the coupons arrived it was time to head to Best Buy.

It had lots of high reviews online, and just because something is cheap doesn't necessarily mean its going to be junk.

As for the converter box I picked up an Apex. There was a big pallet of them when I entered the store, so it was pretty easy to find. When I got home I first tried hooking up the antenna directly to the HDTV. "Maybe my TV already already had a digital tuner built in" I thought. It didn't. The picture quality was about as good as I remember growing up on the farm. Then I hooked up the digital converter box. It made a HUGE difference! The stations were coming in as well as they did over cable, maybe better. Then I realized something I hadn't thought about, this converter box doesn't do HD. I could still use this box for my TV upstairs, but now I needed to find an HD over the air tuner. 

To be continued...
