I was so busy last week I couldn't even post news. To make up for it, here's a <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=330>comic.</a>

Ok, I'm hooked on Final Fantasy Tactics Advance now that K-Dog finally explained the way you get abilities. We also got a chance to team up on a mission, that was really cool.

Also as far as the tshirts I am extending the offer. I still hope to get them sent out by the end of the month. Thanks for you patience.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030915.gif'   />
