I finally got the <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=67>new comic</a> up. I was going to do it when I got home at 2 am but could just not think of any good ideas. That's not saying I came up with a good idea this morning, you can decide that for yourself. Last night I was hanging out with friends at George House and then we went to K-Dog's dorm to play Worms on the DC.
