The Jaguar release at Easton was not at all what I expected. When kruton, Goz and I got there at 9:15 there were about 20 people waiting. I didn't think there would be many more people than that so we went to GameWorks for a couple rounds of DDR. When we got back at 10 there were already a couple hundred people in line. All in all the event was pretty lame as we stood in line with a bunch of freaks just to get inside a store I've been to dozens of times before.

Saturday night kruton, the youth group and I went back to Columbus for a Christian rock concert. Squad 50, Thousand Foot Krutch and Reliant K are all pretty cool bands, and if you haven't heard them, check them out.

Kruton moved back to the dorm Sunday as you can see by this <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=44>comic.</a> I gave XBOX Live another try and it looks like they worked out the network problems because I was in a race within a minute of turning on the XBOX. I also had no trouble at all finding people to play with. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020826.gif'   />
