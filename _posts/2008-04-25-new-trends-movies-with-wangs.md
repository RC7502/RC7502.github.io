For decades guys has been born with what I will call the male wang. However you might not know that if all of your anatomy knowledge comes from movies. The wang has been largely absent from mainstream cinema until very recently. Boogie Nights in 1997 was a pioneer in showing a wang on film for some reason. There may have been movies before this one but this is the first I can think of without doing any research whatsoever. Ten years later the wang is really starting to get it's time to shine in the limelight. Walk Hard has one scene that features what seems like an eternity of wang exposure. Even the Simpsons movie has a brief glimpse at Bart's wang which is actually kinda creepy if you think about him only being ten years old. The most recent movie wang is Jason Segal's in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

But why is the wang getting so much attention in new movies? I think the obvious reason is that it's there for the ladies enjoyment. More movies that you can count have female nudity for the non-gay dudes to appreciate (or maybe even gay dudes, do they like female nudity? I have no idea, I guess I shouldn't assume they don't). Women have seen plenty shirtless guys but not enough stuff south of the border. These new movies are like affirmative action for genitalia. 

So the next time you're at the movies and you see a wang on screen don't be horrified. Just turn to your wife/girlfriend/female friend and say "this scene's for you baby."
