Corrections:<br />
After our recording I realized that some of the email sent to podcast@bitsmack.com was caught by my junk mail filter. Craig Maloney got our question of the week right! He also sent his thoughts on Star Trek video games but for some reason the mp3 didn't come through. If you could send that again Craig, we'll play it next week.<br />
<br />
This weeks question: What format must video be converted to, to play on the PSP?
