When I heard about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019XZDZO?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0019XZDZO">Smart People</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0019XZDZO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> it sounded good, it has Ellen Page, Dennis Quaid, Sarah Jessica Parker and the Sandman with a porn star mustache. Unfortunately, this movie is just too boring to recommend. 

Smart People tells the story of a pretentious, arrogant, mess of a person college professor, his two children and his adopted brother. The professor starts dating his doctor who was also a former student of his. They break up then get back together, the end. Don't get me wrong I love independent movies but just making it boring does not make it artistic. There's no insightful dialogue, deep meaningful revelations, or any plot to speak of. 

I can't really recommend this movie to anyone. I tried to think if there was a certain type of person this would appeal to, but I came up with nothing. I give it a 0. 

4 = own it
3 = rent it
2 = watch it on tv while doing other things
1 = watch it just to make fun of how terrible it is
0 = never watch under any circumstances no matter how curious you are
