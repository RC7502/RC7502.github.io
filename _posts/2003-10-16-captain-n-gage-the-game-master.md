Ahhhh the time has come to review my new lil pocket friend the N-gage. Gagey has been spending a lot of time with me answer my voice mails, using speech recognition calls, creating ringtones, trying to sync with Bluetooth enabled Macintoshes, and just playing Monkey Ball and I can say I enjoy having him around. The other day we made a conference call to help my buddy in Cleveland fix his computer! I will say the N-gage is <B>NOT</B> for JUST gaming. The N-gage's main function is being a phone.
<br />

<br />
<B>DO NOT FORGET THAT!</B>

I would not have purchased one if it was JUST for gaming. The phone features are incredible! The whole thing also works as a personal orgainizer. The phone can sync up to the computer (PC only I beleive as I cannot contact Nokia to verify this) and it can do just about everything a Palm can do. Plus my version of Monkey ball is WAAAAAY better than RC's version on his SPrint PCS phone.

Bottom line, if you're a gamer and want a TRUE gaming Cell phone get the N-gage and a service plan for one of the GSM networks. If you're NOT looking for a cell phone <b>DO NOT BUY AN N-GAGE!</B>
