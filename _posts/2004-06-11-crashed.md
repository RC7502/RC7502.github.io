If you thought I was done with the MAME cabinet you'd be wrong, just like me. After the power went out one day the computer wouldn't boot up. It said it was missing a system file in Windows. I reinstalled Windows 2000 and it ran until the power went out again. I'm not sure if it's the hard drive or the motherboard. I have had only problems with that computer ever since I put in that motherboard.

This meant a trip to Computer Success. They have a big selection of preowned office compupters. I got an IBM PIII 650, 128MB RAM, 10GB hard drive, onboard sound and NIC, all for about $115. I put in another 128MB RAM and installed my 60GB hard drive. However when I started up Game Launcher the first time, if I hit up or down on the joystick it would scroll forever. I have to figure out what is going on with my keyboard or the X-Arcade.
