<strong>Frankenstein Agent of SHADE</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Frankenstein and some monsters form a super hero team.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Probably not, but it is pretty fun. 

<strong>Fury of the Firestorm</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Two guys who don't like each other get the same powers and can combine to form a fiery Hulk. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. Seeing the bad guys kill a little boy and his family turned me off from the start. 

<strong>Green Arrow</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Green Arrow is more like how the character was on Smallville and doesn't have terrible facial hair. <br>
Will I keep reading it: I think so. I liked this book. 

<strong>Green Lantern</strong><br>
What I think is going on: I know almost nothing about Green Lantern and didn't see the new movie. Hal doesn't have a ring anymore but Sinestro does.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Yes. I like that a bad guy is now a Green Lantern and this issue left me wanting more.

<strong>Green Lantern Corps</strong><br>
What I think is going on: 2 other Green Lanterns are trying to find day jobs. I thought each Lantern was for a specific sector. If so why are so many humans? <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. I liked the other Lantern books better.

<strong>Green Lantern New Guardians</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Now another human is becoming a Lantern. In fact he gets 1 ring of each color. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Yes. I want to see what happens with this guy getting all these rings at once. 

<strong>Grifter</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Sawyer from Lost is being chased by weird monsters. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Nope. 

<strong>Hawk and Dove</strong><br>
What I think is going on: A guy who is stupid and angry is forced to team up with a girl. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. I have the entire first run of X-Force so can't take any more Rob Leifield. 

<strong>I, Vampire</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Some vampires (or werewolves, I can't even tell) alternate between being emo and standing over dead bodies. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. This could be the fatigue of reading all these #1s setting in but I had no interest in this comic. 

<strong>Justice League Dark</strong><br>
What I think is going on: The regular Justice League falls apart whenever magic is involved. So they have to bring in a new team. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Maybe. I like Zatanna and John Constantine. 

Stay tuned for more reviews!
