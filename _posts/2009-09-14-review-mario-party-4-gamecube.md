Goldsmith Jr. invented video games in 1947</a> because he was tired of people cheating at Monopoly. 

You start out by picking which character you want to control. If Luigi is Mario's creepy brother and Wario is an evil version of Mario, Waluigi must be a registered sex offender. Next, you decide how long the game should last by picking the number of turns ranging from 10 (let's get this over with before people get distracted by the squirrel outside) to 50 (maybe if I make this game long enough my friends will never leave me). For tonight's game Ashley agreed to play and we picked 20 turns, which lasted about an hour. The object of the game is to have the most stars by the end of the predefined turns. You get stars by rolling a dice and moving around a game board towards the star giver guy. At the end of each turn you play a minigame that's either a free for all, 2 vs. 2 or 1 vs. 3. Most of the minigames are so simple just about anyone can do it. They even give you a chance to practice beforehand. 

Most of the game is harmless fun but there are a couple things that make no sense whatsoever. When you pass a turtle guy he stops you and says you have to put 5 coins in the bank to move on. BANKS DO NOT WORK THIS WAY. Also, when you finally get to the turtle that hands out stars he asks you "do you want to pay 20 coins for a star?". "Uh no Mr. Turtle, I don't want to purchase the item that is sole deciding factor on who wins the game." Seriously what kind of strategy is there to NOT buying the star? It'd be like rolling Yahtzee on your first turn and being like "I think I'll put that in Chance". And why do I have to buy my star anyway? When someone wins in the Olympics does a shady guy walk up to them and say "you Michael Phelps? you want gold medal? that's $50"?

Overall Mario Party 4 is a average party game. There's not really any exciting highs or crappy lows. It's a continuous level of fun from start to finish.
