Goz, aka "the guy who finally got an N64 last year" has now joined the next generation of <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=337>video gamers.</a>

In other news, I have finally decided to cancel my Gamefly subscription. I know I have praised the service since day one and I have no complaints about it. I now realize that I prefer quality over quantity. I'd rather play a few great games than a bunch of so-so games. Most of the games I rented were action games which I don't really get into anymore. Right now I am hooked on RPGs and they take up a lot of time. The other thing I realized is that there really aren't a lot of 9-10 level games being released. It's not like I'm missing a lot of really great games. So while I still think the service is great, it just isn't for me anymore.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030929.gif' alt'' />
