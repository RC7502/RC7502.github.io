Last Heroes before Christmas break! Will everything be wrapped up nicely? Let's find out together!

<!--more-->

Previously on Heroes, the scene where Sulu mistakes Hiro for the chef is somehow crucial to the plot.

Peter stands over Arthur's dead body. The Hatian must have gone out for a cup of coffee. Nathan comes in and tells Peter he is fully on board for Team Arthur. They have already started injecting soldiers with super serum. Nathan sure has switched sides suddenly.

Noah, Girl Pyro, Claire and Angela Petrelli are locked in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">high school</span> Primatech by Sylar. Now that he knows Mama Petrelli is not HIS Mama Petrelli he's going to take it out on Team Angela. They break out some shotguns and I cross my fingers this turns into some kind of Resident Evil/Heroes fan fiction.

Team Parkman checks out Suresh's lab but no one is home. They recap what everyone's powers are and that they are trying to find a way to save Hiro in the past, hanging on a pole. Here's a thought, why don't they check out newspapers from 16 years ago and find out if anyone fell off a building that day? They'd at least know if he died or not.

Suresh wants to inject himself with the new formula injected with Soul Glo. Let's follow his logic. First time he injected himself with a formula he turned into The Lizard, so if he injects himself a second time, he'll be cured?! Peter tries to save Suresh by threatening to shoot him. Before anything happens Speedster swoops in and makes off with the loot. Just then, Blue Pyro and The Scarecrow (what was he doing during the whole eclipse?) show up because they like wrecking joints. Peter says "I like wrecking joints too!" and they flip over tables, leaving no test tube or beaker unbroken. Scarecrow welcomes Peter to the good side. WHA? I thought Scarecrow and Blue Pyro were working for Arthur. When did that change?

Captain America comes to Nathan's aid. He's says no one else has been injected yet. Then The Scarecrow walks in and snaps Cap's neck. America morns it's Fallen Son. (Seriously, why did they bother introducing this guy to us just to kill him off right away?)

Speedster brings back the formula and Ando is like "I'm tired of being the only guy on this show that doesn't have powers. Look at Sylar he's got like a dozen!" (Note: You may think Noah doesn't have powers but his is super badassness). Ando takes the syringe and jabs it as hard as humanly possible into his arm. This has to break ever rule in the Nurse Practitioner's Handbook plus it's completely unnecessary.

Hiro finally gets off of the pole he was stuck on. Apparently all he had to do was change his <strong>pole position. </strong>Anyway, he decides the best thing to do when you are in the past is try and screw up the timeline as much as possible. So he asks past him where Sulu hides his secret formulas.

Sylar calls up Claire and tells her he'll let her go if she blows Angela's head off. She doesn't. She takes out her aggression on the phone instead. Angela is like "uh those phones cost money you know." Noah in the meantime decides to let The Puppet Master and two other goons from Sector 7G go as bait for Sylar. Either one of them catches Sylar (highly unlikely) or all three get slaughtered. It's a win-win!

Peter continues breaking graduated cylinders and Blue Pyro gives Suresh a much deserved beat down.

Ando wakes up and completely gives up pretending that English is not his native language. He tries to time travel but no luck. Instead his ability is that his arm can produce red flavor crystals like Cinnaburst gum. This surprises no one as we saw Ando use a similar ability in the future back at the beginning of the season.

The Puppet Master puts up a good show against Sylar but of course he's no match. Sylar jams a syringe in Girl Pyro's chest. "Shot to the heart, and you're to blame, you give Heroes, a bad name." Sylar locks Girl Pyro and Noah in a cell. She can't control her flames and they'll use up all the oxygen. Noah has to kill her or suffocate.

Nathan and Scarecrow get in a scuffle. Tracy breaks it up by breaking Scarecrow into a million frozen pieces. She says "miss me?" No, we miss Micah and Monica.

Parkman touches Ando's arm and the flavor crystals boost Matt's powers. He can hear the thoughts of everyone in the city. Speedster touches him and goes back in time a few seconds.

Team Angela uses teamwork and breaks Noah out of the cell. Girl Pyro stays behind.

Tracy wants to pack up shop and run away. Nathan fires her. Tracy makes her Ali Larter intense face.

Parkman finally figures out what everyone else already knew, that Ando can boost abilities. I guess that doesn't explain his Dragonball Z power earlier in the season. The two Hiros break into Sulu's safe and get the formula. Sulu catches them and tries to kill old Hiro. Hiro holds up the formula and Sulu cuts it in half. Thus concludes the origin of why the formula paper was split in two. Speedster and Ando grab Hiro and head Back to the Future! Then Speedster and Hiro decide to go destroy the formula. Tracy has it and calls Hiro "Pikachu". The nerve! Hiro does the most awesome thing and punches Tracy right in her stupid face.

Peter and Blue Pyro, while still smashing stuff, tip over a big vat of Kool Aid. It washes over Suresh, curing him. Suresh is like "Oh yeah!" Then Nathan comes in and starts beating the crap out of Peter with the lead pipe, in the laboratory. Nathan sure has changed from the self sacrificing dude at the end of Season 1. Peter injects himself with the formula using the Ando "jam it into your body as hard as you can" method of drug administration. He gets his abilities back and flies Nathan out before the lab explodes (as they always do).

My DVR goes from screwing up video and audio to cutting off the end of the episode completely, so I switch to Hulu.

Angela fesses up to Sylar that she's not his mom and she used him for his killing abilities. She knows who his real parents are. Before he can force it out of her Claire jabs a huge hunk of glass into the back of his head. Claire goes back to save her real mom but her fire powers are out of control. There is an explosion and it chases Noah and Claire down a hallway, 80s style.

You gotta have a montage! It shows us what everyone is up to while voiceover guy spouts some nonsense.

End of Volume Three

Start of Volume Four "Fugitives"

Three weeks later, Nathan gives President Worf information on all the people he knows that have powers. Nathan wants the government to start the mutant registration act and round them up. Worf agrees.

TO BE CONTINUED!!!!
