<strong>Why did I get this game?</strong>
I remember watching The Wizard in the theater and how amazed we were to see Super Mario Bros. 3 for the first time. I think next to the first SMB, SMB3 is probably in just about everyone's NES collection. However, I wouldn't rate it as my favorite SMB game. In fact, it's probably tied for least favorite with Super Mario Sunshine.

<strong>Let's do it!</strong>
I started up a new game. I do like the overworld map which is the precursor to Super Mario World. Oh, for some reason I can't pick up turtle shells. Am I thinking of a different game? There are these blocks with music notes on them, but they don't play music when you hit them. What's up with that? I got the raccoon tail but when I try to run with it I keep twirling around. I think I'd rather not have the tail. I don't see the point of doing levels 1-3 or 1-4. Sure there is a mushroom hut on the other side but it's not quite worth it. 

I had to use a continue already but I made it through the first world. I hope I don't have a limited amount of continues. Next time I'll work on World 2.
