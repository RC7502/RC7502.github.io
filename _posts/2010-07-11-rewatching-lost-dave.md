Hurley and Libby are working out on the beach Biggest Loser style. Might as well face it Hurley's addicted to food. They decide to trash his secret supply of food while the other survivors are like "uh other people could use that food you know."

On the island: Hurley sees his imaginary friend who tells him to eat.
Off the island: Hurley sees his imaginary friend who tells him to eat.

Seeing this again, my theory is that Dave on the island was actually the smoke monster. He can't kill Hurley directly because he is a candidate so that's why he is trying to convince Hurley to kill himself. 

Ashley's note: Dave loses his sandal in the woods and Hurley finds it, it's like Cinderella.
