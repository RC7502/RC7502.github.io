Here's another Jack episode. It opens on his eye again but this time it's when he was a kid. 

On the island: There's a water shortage, and Jack chases a ghost into the woods.
Off the island: Jack's dad asks Jack where he learned to be such a jerk and Jack replies "I learned it from watching you!"

A woman drowns at the beginning of the episode and Jack says there are now 46 of them. So let's track them:
Jack, Hurley, Locke, Kate, Michael, Walt, Boone, Shannon, Sayid, Charlie, Claire, Rose, Sawyer, Jin, Sun. That's 15 that we know about. Maybe later on I'll be able to figure out just how many disappeared with no mention. 

So it seems like the smoke monster was trying to lure Jack to the fresh water. My theory is that at this point the smoke monster needed to keep them alive because he needs someone to kill Jacob. 

Q8. Jack's mom makes a reference to something Jack did to his father
A8. I think we find out later that Jack's dad was drunk during surgery and Jack turned him in
