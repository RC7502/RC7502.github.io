<a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10786_3-6172719.html?part=rss&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20&amp;subj=news">Engage super pursuit mode to buy 'Knight Rider' car</a>:<blockquote>K.I.T.T., the car that regaled us with witty banter alongside David Hasselhoff in the 1980s TV series Knight Rider, is for sale in a San Francisco Bay Area suburb for a mere $149,995. Officially known as the Knight Industries Two Thousand, the 1982 Pontiac Firebird will be on display at Kassabian Motors in Dublin, Calif., for a month.<br />
</blockquote>I think the guy is asking way too much. For $150,000 I would expect a date with David Hasselhoff (or at least William Daniels, but I'd settle for Patricia McPherson) and that they pay for it.
