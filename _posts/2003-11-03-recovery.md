After partying all weekend I just couldn't get a comic done. I wanted to do one about the DevryGuyz party, but I couldn't think of anything that happened that would be funny to people who weren't there. Saturday night I went out with Goz and a few of his friends. I could have done a really good comic about Goz, but I think it would tarnish his good standing in the community. Anyway, I'm back in Cincinnati for 3 more days this week to get this client up and running. I am sooooooooooo looking forward to getting back to Columbus and this weekend.
