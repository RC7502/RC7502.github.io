For the last year or so some of the bigger movies have been including a digital copy on the DVD release. This is nice if you want to put the movie on your iPod and take it with you. I don't know how many people use this feature. Is it a lot? Can normal people figure out how to get a digital movie on their iPod? Well if they couldn't before this isn't going to make things any easier. According to <a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/kotaku/full/~3/OG4i8YQSdkI/sony-adding-psp+only-digital-copies-to-blu+ray-discs">this article</a> Sony is going to start releasing digital copies with some of their Bluray movies. The catch is that these digital copies will only play on a PSP. Not an iPod like most people have. I think this is a bad idea because it'll be confusing to people to the point that they won't want to bother with digital movies.

The first two Bluray movies to offer this feature are the 1998 film Godzilla and The Ugly Truth so maybe Sony doesn't even want this to succeed. After all, is there anyone that owns a PSP AND wants to see The Ugly Truth?
