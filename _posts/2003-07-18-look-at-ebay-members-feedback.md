In a number of my reviews I've told readers that games can be found on Ebay. You can even search for games on Ebay from this website. But before bidding, consider something. Look at the sellers feedback.
<br />
If a seller has a number of negative feedbacks, don't bid. I never received an item from an Ebay seller. I then looked at the person's feedback and I wasn't the only person who didn't receive their merchandise. The seller had eight other negative feedbacks.
<br />
Ebay is one of the greatest things on the internet and most Ebay sellers are honest. But it pays to be cautious.
