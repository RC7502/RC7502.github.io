I think I'm finished using Cafepress. Their prices were too high and their T-Shirts weren't that great. This time I'm taking preorders and getting a batch of shirts professionally done. The design on the shirt is basically the steps you have to take to play an NES game. Since this is the first shirt I'm not ordering a lot. You'll have to preorder to guarantee that you'll get one. I hope to get them sent out in September. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030829.gif' alt'' />
