TV shows are asking a lot more out of its viewers nowadays by having season long story arcs that require you to watch every episode to keep up. Is this a good thing? I used to think so, but now I think I am changing my mind.

Back in the 80s TV shows were for the most part self contained stories or occasionally two-parters that were always wrapped up neatly in the end. You can watch the episodes of Knight Rider or A-Team in any order and it doesn't really matter. However, many of today's television shows like Lost, Heroes and The Nine are made up of one continuous storyline that takes place over the whole season. I used to think this was awesome, because at the end of each episode everything <em>isn't </em>back to normal. But stretching out story lines over several months just means that less happens in each individual episode. I think the shows that have done it best are X-Files, Buffy and Angel. These shows had a mixture of episodes that were part of a larger storyline, and episodes that were self contained. This kept things interesting throughout the season so you aren't just biding your time until the season finale. I think the show that would benefit most from this philosophy is Heroes. They are putting a lot of time into this "save the cheerleader" storyline when I would rather see more character development in one shot episodes.

So what do you think? Do you like shows that have season long story arcs or ones that are self contained?
