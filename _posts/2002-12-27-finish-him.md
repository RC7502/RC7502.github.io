Sometimes I base comics on events in my life, then there's <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=96>today's comic.</a>
<br />
<br />
I had the typical holiday: presents, food, battle for world domination. K-Dog, Goz and I played a cuthroat game of Risk. Goz won, but fortunatly this was "Lord of the Rings" Risk which means Goz currently only reigns over Middle Earth and not this planet.
<br />
<br />
K-Dog finally got an XBOX. We played co-op on Serious Sam and it was a lot of fun.
<br />
<br />
Lastly, I got a chance to check out a couple of really cool cartoons this week. The first is Undergrads. It is awesome. I think it does a good job of depicting college life from a geek's point of view. You should definately check it out on Comedy Central. The other cartoon was Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I can't describe how messed up this cartoon is. It is on Cartoon Network Adult Swim.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021227.gif' alt'' />
