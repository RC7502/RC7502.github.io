I actually made a comic last night but I forgot to upload it, so you'll have to wait until I get home from work. <br />

Last weekend Brad, Va, Cassadi, Jace and I decided to play Magic the Gathering because none of us had played in so long. Since noone could find their cards we decided to have a draft tournament. We first went to Meijer, but their card selection was lacking. After that we went to this comic book store that I had seen driving home from work. It turned out to be a very nice store and the guys working there were really friendly. We each got a fourth edition deck and three booster packs from the newer series. Playing five player magic was really fun and makes me want to keep playing. I haven't played Magic in seven years and even then I only played K-Dog who consistantly beat me. I think that's why I didn't get hooked before. <br />

It's funny how lately our circle of friends has been feeling nostalgic for 90s games. Last night I installed Starcraft on my machine because we've been talking about having an old school LAN party. I think it would also be cool to get out some Doom II or maybe even Heretic. I haven't played either of those forever. So what do you guys think, are the 90s retro now?
