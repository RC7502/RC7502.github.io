After a week of Halo 3 I think I can sum up the game pretty succinctly. I could go on and on about new multiplayer options, joining parties, online co-op but really the best thing Halo 3 has going for it is "everyone is playing it". Since the game has come out every night I've turned on my 360 at least one or two people on my friends list is playing Halo 3. So what would you do in this situation. 

1. You could play a game that got perfect 10s in every review you read, but no one you know has it.

2. You could play an above average game, but everyone you know plays all the time.

Halo 3 is like choosing option 2. I would rate the multiplayer aspect a 9 and the single player campaign a 7 which averages out to an 8 overall. The single player campaign bored me to tears even when playing with 3 of my friends on co-op (With the exception of the final level which was a hilarious execution of trial and error). So all you need to know about Halo 3 is if you plan on playing online it is a must have, if you are buying for the single player only it is a rental at best.
