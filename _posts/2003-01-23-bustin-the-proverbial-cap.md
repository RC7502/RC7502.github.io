I've been enjoying the Metroid series for the past couple of weeks.
<br />

<br />
I beat Metroid Fusion roughly a week ago. At the end of the game, I came away with an empty feeling. The game was too confining as far as level design went, and it lacked a lot of the explorative properties that made its predecessors special. With lackluster boss battles (save for a choice few) and an ending that seems forced upon the player, Fusion lacks. Period.
<br />

<br />
After I got my Gamecube cash from Keaton, I sat down to soak in Metroid Prime. I didn't know what to expect -- was I going to breeze past this just like Metroid Fusion? I snapped the disc into the system, cradled my controller for the first time, and absorbed. 
<br />

Metroid Prime is a first person adventure title. However, the game sucks you in unlike any other title of the same nature. Playing Metroid Prime is truly an out of body experience -- you aren't an excited kid sitting at your TV. You are Samus Aran. You are blasting the hell out of Baby Sheegoth's, you are letting loose vapor trails courtesy of your wave beam, and you're exploring the colorful environment that surrounds you.

I'm roughly three hours in....
