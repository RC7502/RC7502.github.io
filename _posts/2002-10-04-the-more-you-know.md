<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=60>Today's comic</a> is a public service announcement on behalf of all gamers. 
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I almost headed out the door without doing today's post. Goz and I have the truck packed up and are ready to head to Cinciclassic. I'm pretty excited because I've never been to a really good classic gaming event and I hear good things about this one. If all goes well I'll have pictures from Cinciclassic and Squidfest up next week.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021004.gif' alt'' />
