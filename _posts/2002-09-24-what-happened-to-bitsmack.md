I was on my way to my bi-weekly column and lo and behold a banner on Bitsmack!?!?! I emplore you, do not be frightened, I'm guessing this is a result of cost of maintaining a completely FREE service and entertainment on the web, not sure exactly but I'm sure RC can clear some of this up.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I have recently played Eternal Darkness and <A HREF="http://www.kingdomhearts.com">Kingdom Hearts</A> and I have to say, Eternal Darkness scares me!!! Of course I was the child who had nightmares of his Zelda and Zelda 2 saves being erased which kept me from playing the game to it's end because I was always frightened of losing my save game, AMEN FOR MEM CARDS!!
<br />

<br />
<A HREF="http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=7311">Eternal Darkness</A> does weird things and <A HREF="http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=202">Kingdom Hearts</A> stars a Squaresoft Final Fantasy like character going from Disney movie to Disney movie trying to stop the heartless from taking over and stealing all the princesses. Of the two, whichever one I get stuck at, I just move to the other.
<br />

<br />
I'm also having DDR depravation, having not played in 8 days. It's like water and being dehydrated, the world and being busy is like a DDR desert, but I'll be ready for Cinciclassic, until then, C-ya

K-dog out!!
