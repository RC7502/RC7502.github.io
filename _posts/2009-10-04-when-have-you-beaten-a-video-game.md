A few weeks ago I talked about <a href="http://bitsmack.com/wp/2009/09/11/using-google-spreadsheets-to-track-game-progress/">how I was using a spreadsheet to track my video game progress.</a> However, one of the issues I keep running into is deciding what qualifies as "beating" a video game. 

In the Atari days there was no way to complete a video game. You kept playing and the game kept getting harder and harder until you lost. Your only goal was to get a new high score. When the NES came along games had stories and once you defeated the final level or boss the game was over. With these older games it's easy to track your progress. If there are 10 levels and you've completed 4 then you are 40% complete. 

Jump ahead to present day. Many games are helpful by supplying you a completion percent based on the number of levels completed and special items picked up. However, for XBOX 360 and PS3 games there are also achievements and trophies to collect. So have I completed the game once I finished the story, or once I unlock all the achievements? In Red Faction: Guerrilla I've finished the story line, but I only have 19 out of 50 achievements. If I base my spreadsheet on achievements I'll never hit 100% but if I base it on story completion I'm not rewarding myself for achievements. 

The solution I came up with for now is that completing the story counts for 90% and achievements, trophies or other bonuses account for 10%. Defeating Bowser at the end of Super Mario 64 would be 90% complete, but getting all 120 stars would be 100%. In my previous Red Faction example I'd be 93.8% based on finishing the story but still having achievements to collect. I think it's a fair system that rewards completing the story more than achievements which are sometimes ridiculously hard. 

What do you think? At what point to you consider a game completed?
