So last night was the first of the last three episodes of Friends. Unfortuantely, the series last funny season ended about four to five years ago. The real tragedy is Angel getting cancelled after this season. If you've never seen the show it is written really well and always has unexpected twists and turns. I could go into a big tirade about how few good shows are on TV now but instead I'm just going to go to bed and dream about a world without "reality television."<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040423.png' alt'' />
