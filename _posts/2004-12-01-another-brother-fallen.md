I bring terrible news from the realm of Tennessee.  Dance Beat Arcade is officially closing it's doors on December 31, 2004.  If you're not familiar with them, they were an arcade for Bemani gamers to have fun and play some of the best games around.  DBA housed:<br />
-5 DDR machines, a DM/GF setup, Keyboardmania, Beatmania IIDX 8th style, Beatmania 7th Mix, 2 Linked PPP 2nd's and a Dance Maniax 2nd append J-paradise.<br />
<br />
they also had an air hockey table, pool table, some fighting games and I believe some shooter games.<br />
<br />
Their 2 year run was dissolved by poor workmanship, breaking games, and a slow cash flow that struggled to keep up with new machine titles and other monetary concerns.<br />
<br />
Their assets will be going up on ebay for all to bid on.  So today we bid farewell to a great East coast rhythm arcade...
