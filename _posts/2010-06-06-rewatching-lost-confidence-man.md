Sawyer is shirtless a lot, this will probably be Ashley's favorite episode. At least until Sayid starts jamming bamboo under his fingernails. 

On the island: Sawyer is willing to be tortured to protect some inhalers he doesn't even have. 
Off the island: Sawyer is a conman. 

Sawyer has a letter from a young boy talking about how a conman slept with the boy's mom and took the dad's money. Then the dad killed the mom and himself. The cool twist in this episode is that Sawyer was the boy that wrote the letter. Also, it's apparently pretty easy to get over drugs. Charlie was sweating and shaking at night and the next day he's doing laundry and eating invisible peanut butter with Claire.

We find out later that the real Sawyer was actually Locke's dad. I didn't list it as an actual question here because the first time I saw this episode I didn't really think it's something we needed to find out. They had bigger things to worry about like getting off the island. 

Ashley's note: mmmm Sawyer, but she refused to watch the torture scene.
