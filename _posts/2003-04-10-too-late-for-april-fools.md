<a href=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/puzzle/ddrxbox/news_6024845.html>Gamespot</a> has posted an article about a possible Dance Dance Revolution game being released for the XBOX. "Holy crap!" I said to myself. Rumors are the game will be Live compatible and allow you to download new songs and characters. This is excellent news for DDR fans who want more mixes and for XBOX fans that want to have ONE rhythm game to play.

As soon as I know for sure I'll have to get a PS2->XBOX controller adapter so I can use the pads.
