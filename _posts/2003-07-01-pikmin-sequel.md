I just want to let People know that the Gamecube Pikmin is getting a sequel. Nintendo is making Pikmin 2.
<br />
Pikmin was a great game and I intend to buy Pikmin 2. I suggest that other Gamecube owners buy it as well.
<br />
For those who have never played Pikmin, you control a man named Captain Olimar. You command an army of plant creatures. You command the Pikmin creatures to attack enemies and carry objects. I'm looking forward to playing Pikmin 2.
