Today is the <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=447>first</a> of my <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=596>comics for Macs campaign.</a> I have had three people sign up already which means I just need seven more. Another thing I found out from Brad is that once you sign up for my offer you can refer 10 of your friends and get your own Mac Mini. I had no idea. It's like a pyramid of value!<br />

One of the features of World of Warcraft is that you can customize the user interface all you want. Probably the most common customization package out there is <a href=http://www.cosmosui.org/>Cosmos.</a> I also use a couple other user mods I found out there. The problem is when Blizzard releases a new patch you have to either wait for new versions of the mods to be released, or manually change the version number on a bunch of files, and that doesn't always mean it will work. Even after I redownloaded Cosmos when I started playing there was something up with the servers because when I was in Ironforge all of the NPCs disappeared. This means I couldn't use the auction house or even take a gryphon out of there. My teleporting stone wouldn't even do anything. I can't wait until they get these server issues fixed because it is very annoying in an otherwise awesome game.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20050223.png' alt'' />
