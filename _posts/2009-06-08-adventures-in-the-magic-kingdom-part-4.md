Wednesday the sun finally came out, for the morning anyway. We went to the Animal Kingdom. This was probably the park I was least excited about, because I don't really care much about animals other than their barbequeability. But I had never been to this park before so it would be all new to me. Since the weather was nice is the morning we took as many pictures as we could. Here are the attractions we saw:

<strong>Safari
</strong>The safari was pretty fun because we got to see some giraffes and elephants and whatnot. It was just like Jurassic Park except with hippos instead of velociraptors. There's a part where you go across a bridge and the bridge shakes. Ashley and I could hear a mother and and her young daughter in the seat behind us:

Mom: woah, I wasn't sure if we were going to make it over that bridge
Daughter: mom, they probably do that like 5 times a day

<strong>Tree People
</strong>This wasn't really an attraction but they had this woman dressed as a tree walking around the park. She walked on stilts and used these long sticks to maintain balance. Her costume was pretty amazing. If she walked up to a tree and faced away from you, you wouldn't even see that she was there.

<strong>Yak &amp; Yeti Restaurant</strong>
We had our sit down meal for lunch. I can't remember what I ate but it was delicious. I don't think we had a bad meal the entire week. During lunch it started pouring, we were glad we had done the safari already.

<strong>Bird Show
</strong>There was a short show where they had trained birds doing tricks. The tricks were meant to imitate how they normally act in the wild. I learned that the bald eagle is no longer endangered thanks to preservation programs.

<strong>Bugs Life 3D</strong>
The Bugs Life 3D movie was pretty funny. I recommend anyone going to the park to check it out.

<strong>The Lion King Live Show
</strong>This show started out so well. They had these moving platforms with robot characters from the Lion King and they were singing songs from the movie. Then these acrobats started... acrobating and it was really cool. At that point they stopped the show because the storm outside was interfering with the power or something. I was disappointed.

<strong>Finding Nemo The Musical</strong>
This was the best show at the Animal Kingdom. There were performers with giant puppets of the Finding Nemo cast. I was really impressed with the girl who was hanging from ropes and spinning around. This is also a must see attraction.

After Finding Nemo we headed back to the hotel and ate dinner there. The rain was so bad the park looked empty as we left.
