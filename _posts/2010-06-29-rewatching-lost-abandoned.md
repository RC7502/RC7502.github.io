Sayid builds Shannon some kind of sex tent. Everything is going great until Walt's ghost busts in.

On the island: Shannon thinks everyone thinks she can't take care of herself.
Off the island: Shannon gets cut off from her step mom and has to take care of herself. 

There's a cool bit of continuity when we find out Shannon's dad was the other car in the accident with Jack's future wife. Jack chose to save her over Shannon's dad. Later on Ana Lucia is talking about how so many people in the tail section got took by The Others. How did they take these people and what did they do with them afterwards?
