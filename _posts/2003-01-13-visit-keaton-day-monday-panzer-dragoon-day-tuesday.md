Well I guess today was the big come to Keaton's room to play video games day. I have played my xbox and PS2 a grand total of 10 minutes which is sad since everyone else has played my xbox for hours and I sit here playing my DDR simulator <A HREF="http://dwi.ddrei.com/">DWI</a>.
<br />

<br />
Tuesday holds the sacred, goto Software to pick up my copy of <A HREF="http://www.sega.com/games/xbox/post_xboxgame.jhtml?PRODID=10079">Panzer Dragoon Orta</a> and see what other free stuff I can get for my reserves and next week <A HREF="http://www.tecmogames.com/games/doax.asp">DOA: Extreme Beach Volleyball!!</a>
<br />

<br />
<A HREF="http://groovemaster.livejournal.com/">Ben's</a> coming up to visit Wednesday. That'll be the  "Play stuff in the lobby" day. I can't wait!
