Now that Thanksgiving is long gone, Ashley and I have been talking about Christmas movies. We decided there are so many we could watch one every night until Christmas. I figured since we're watching them I might as well review them while I'm at it. First up, we rented Fred Claus.

<iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=bitsmack-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&m=amazon&f=ifr&md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&asins=B000YABV7W" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" align="left"></iframe>In Fred Claus, Vince Vaughn plays the older brother of Nick Claus. They put some cop out thing in the beginning that because Nick is a saint he and his family doesn't age. That brings us to present day. Since Fred is kinda the opposite of Nick I think it's funny that Fred works as a repo man. They play the song Surfin Bird early on which BOOM earns an instant 2 stars in this review.

Vince Vaughn is at his best when he is talking fast and going on his long rants. Kevin Spacey reprises his role from Seven except that instead of putting heads in boxes he wants to shut down the north pole. The weird thing is instead of using little people to play the elves they superimposed the faces of regular actors on little people's bodies. It's like a creepy movie version of <a href="http://www.elfyourself.com/">Elf Yourself</a>. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604747/">Jeffery Dean Morgan</a> makes a brief appearance which makes this the first time I've ever seen him play a character that wasn't dead. There's a ton of random physical humor thrown in for kids and a few jokes here and there for adults. The middle part of the movie is pretty slow but then there are some great cameos that are pretty funny. 

Overall, Fred Claus is a good rental during the holiday season. It's got some laughs but I don't think it's quite classic enough to be worth owning. 3.5 out of 5 stars.
