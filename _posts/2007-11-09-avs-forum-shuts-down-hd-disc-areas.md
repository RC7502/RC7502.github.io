I guess&nbsp; people have gotten pretty passionate about their high def disc. It's gotten so bad the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/">AVS Forum</a> has had to shut down their forums dedicated to high definition disc formats.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/announcement.php?f=151&amp;a=116">AVS Forum - Announcements in Forum : Blu-ray &amp; HD DVD Areas</a>:<blockquote>We have seen members attacking other members not only in debate, which is the right way, but with physical threats that have involved police and possible legal action.<br />
</blockquote>Ever since Mattel released the Intellivsion to combat the Atari 2600, fan boys have battled on which system is best. Now that the Internet has given any schmuck a voice and the courage that used to only come from a bottle, the battles have kicked it up a notch. Battling over which high def disc format is best is a moot point at best so far. They both have their pros and cons.<br />
<br />
It seems like the most ardent supporters of Bluray are PS3 owners, who seem disappointed at the sales of their systems so far. PS3 fanboys believed that the inclusion of Bluray sealed the success of the PS3, but in reality, the higher cost of bluray has depressed the sales of the PS3. <br />
<br />
Myself, I just wish dual players would be released or one format would win over the other.
