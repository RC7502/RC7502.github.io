When I got home from work I was greeted by a strange noise coming from my computer. My hard drive was struggling like an old car. And then... nothing.

So the BBS will be down until I get a new hard drive. You think that sucks, I don't have a computer at all! Anyway, if anyone wants to do a guest comic now is your chance. Email your entries to comics@bitsmack.com. If I don't get any guest comics. we're all screwed.
