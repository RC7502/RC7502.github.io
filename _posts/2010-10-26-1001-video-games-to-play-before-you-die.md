I preordered it and it arrived today. This book is huge. There is about 1 page for each game with a couple paragraphs to explain it, most of them have a picture. It's a really nice book with a lot of games I have never tried, and a few I haven't heard of. I was thinking how much fun it would be to play every game in here and write about the experience. If I played 1 game a week it would take almost 20 years to complete. If I played 1 game a day it would only take about 4 years. I think I am going to aim for somewhere in between, a few a week.

The games in the book are not ranked at all, they are just listed in chronological order. If I am going to play them all I don't want to go in order. I think it would be boring to play games from the same era all at once. Instead I am using a random number generator to pick the page of the game to play next. What do you guys think? Is this something that would be interesting to you?
