Overall, it wasn't horrible at all. The movie tells the story of a girl in the 60s (and they are very clear to point it out to us that it is the 60s by showing us a date on a newspaper, because we wouldn't have been able to figure it out by the clothes, cars, black and white TVs, etc.) who wants to be on this dance TV show hosted by Cyclops. She makes it on the show despite not being as good looking as the kids whom I am told are from High School Musical. Eventually there are some racial issues that come up but all the problems are solved by the end with dancing (just like in life). John Travolta plays the overweight mom, Christopher Walken is the dad and together they make the creepiest couple on film. 

The music is catchy and there is some really funny racial humor, especially considering this is a PG movie. So if you're a guy and you ever have to watch this, it's a pretty good movie. I give it a 2.5 on this scale:

4 = own it
3 = rent it
2 = watch it on tv while doing other things
1 = watch it just to make fun of how terrible it is
0 = never watch under any circumstances no matter how curious you are
