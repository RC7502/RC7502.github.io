Hey all, this is The Raj! Now you may be perplexed and thinking to your feeble self, “Why has The Raj invaded the sanctity which we adore as BitSmack?” Its simple people… I got what I wanted so now I feel I must give back. I got my comic, my funny BitSmack comic. Isn’t it great? But Russ is a genius of the comical arts, and for that we should be doing something for him. It is my mark (and challenge to you) to try and write at least 5 reviews for this site every week.  Lets give Russ our support, and others should join in my kudos to RC… write reviews!<br />
