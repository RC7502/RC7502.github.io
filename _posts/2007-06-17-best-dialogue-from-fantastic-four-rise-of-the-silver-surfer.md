General Hagar: No, you don't understand. So let me make it clear for you and your pack of freaks here. I'm the quarterback and you're on my turf here. Got it? But i guess you never played football in high school, did you Richards? <br />
<br />
Reed Richards: No, you're right. I didn't. I stayed in and studied like a good little nerd. And fifteen years later, I'm one of the greatest minds of the 21st century. I'm engaged to the hottest girl on the planet. And the big jock who played quarterback in high school? He's standing right in front of me, asking me for my help. And I say he's not going to get a damn thing unless he does exactly what I tell him and starts treating my friends and me with some respect.<br />
<br />
General Hagar: (pauses) Give him what he wants.<br />
<br />
Susan Storm: I'm so hot for you right now.
