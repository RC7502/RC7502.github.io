As mentioned in <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=64>today's comic</a> kruton won the DDR tournament last weekend. It was a close match between him and BIL, the guy who beat my high score on basic double. He's a cool guy though and I'm glad he got second. I have to say this was the closest tournament I've ever seen. There were about 4 or 5 rounds where a person won by only a few perfects. All in all it was a good time and I think its going to become a monthly event in Findlay.

I've also been playing a lot of MotoGP on Xbox Live and I have to say I'm impressed with how easy it is to get into a game. I've met a lot of cool people online to play against. The game itself it somewhat difficult and it takes awhile to get use to controlling a motorcycle. My Project Gotham skills didn't transfer over to this game.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021014.gif'   />
