According to CNN, <cite cite="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/10/16/meteorite.kansas.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/10/16/meteorite.kansas.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories">an unusual meteorite has been found in Kansas</a>. </cite><blockquote cite="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/10/16/meteorite.kansas.ap/index.html?section=cnn_topstories">Scientists located a rare meteorite in a wheat field thanks to new ground penetrating radar technology that someday might be used on Mars.</blockquote><p/><p/>Unfortunately, this new find probably won't help make Smallville any better this season.<br/>
