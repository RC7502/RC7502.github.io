I recently read something in the newest Tips & Tricks that sounds like great news. CAPCOM supposedly agreed to a crossover arcade fighter with Sammy. The result with be Guilty Gear fighters mixing it up with CAPCOM fighters. The idea is to have CAPCOM feature mostly fighters from its Darkstalkers franchise in order to match the dark, rock 'n roll theme of GGX. While it seemed the source was fairly sure the game is a reality, we'll just have to wait and see for more details.  I'm surely excited about it.

In other news, it seems Spike TV is looking to jump into the video gaming mix.  They are planning an upcoming "video game awards" type event.  Players can go to www.spiketv.com and click on the link to vote in multiple categories.  Going through the categories, I found several nominees to be very lame, as I cast in numerous write-in votes, but it is sort of cool.
