<big>WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS KING KONG MOVIE GAME SPOILERS.  DO NOT READ IF YOU STILL PLAN ON SEEING THE MOVIE.</big>
I completed <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/kingkong/index.html?tag=result;title;4">King Kong</a>.  It took longer than I would have liked thanks to the game-lacks-an-autosave feature.  It was a very disappointing hit for movie games.  Seeing that <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/">GS</a> gave it an 8.2 makes me disappointed in them as well. 

King Kong follows the two-hits-you-die health bar that flashes after you've been hit almost to the point you can't see what's going on and starts playing dead people music.  The weapon system is smart to the point where you can carry one gun, one spear/bone and one puzzle item.  The people around you commonly carry a spear/bone and there's one guy (who dies toward the end) who almost always has a gun.  The nice thing is you can select one of them and they'll throw you whatever they are carrying.  Enemies include raptors, t-rexes (dubbed v-rex), bats and bugs.  There are really only twi types of puzzles.  Distract the spiders so they don't kill you and find the stick that lets you open the door.  Unfortunately once you find out you need the stick to open the door you usually have to distract the spiders to get the stick...

The best part of this game comes from the last two levels.  King Kong running around a very small version of New York City.  You finally get to smash cars and airplanes!  Every other level is just a pain and king kong battles are pretty jerky at best.

Lastly, I'd like to note this was a release title and had some neat cinematics from the movie with Jack Black.  The achievements are straightforward where you only need to beat the game to 1K it.  It's probably less than 5 hours but took me a few days because I don't usually have 5 hours to play games much anymore.  I'd recommend a <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com">FAQ</a> because you'll anger yourself when you can't find the stupid stick.

Next up: 1K in Iron Man

K-dog out!!
