Have you ever read the Bitsmack comic and said "that's stupid, I could do WAY better than that." Well jerk, now is the chance to prove it. I am leaving for vacation in a week and I need guest comics. Because of my incredibly low standards, only the most terrible and offensive comics will be rejected. Email your comics to ithinkimfunny at bitsmack dot com by June 11th with the subject line "Guest Comic". Keep the size under 700x700 pixels. You have the power.
