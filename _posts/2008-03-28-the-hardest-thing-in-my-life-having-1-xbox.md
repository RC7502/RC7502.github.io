When Rock Band was announced last year the first thing that came to mind was the cheap (in quality, not price) Drummania knockoff controller I bought back in 2002 so that I could play drums on my Japanese PS2. I was ready to avoid Rock Band until I played it at K-Dog's house and those stupid jerks at Harmonix roped me in with their semi-realistic drumming simulation. $180 later I had my own drum game (with vestigial guitar and microphone) at my house. Unfortunately, like a T block in Tetris when all you have is a four square opening, the drum controller in my living room just wasn't a good fit. I moved my XBOX 360 to the basement where there is plenty of room in which to rock. However, my TV down there is an old timey low-def. If I want to play games other than Rock Band I have to move my 360 back upstairs. What a hassle!

The Hardest Thing In My Life is only having one XBOX 360 and moving it between the upstairs and downstairs.
