<img src=http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/screen1/914993_20030630_thumb007.jpg align=left>From the "future games K-Dog will buy" department, <a href=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/karaokerevolution/news_6073828.html>Gamespot </a> has posted a song list for the upcoming Konami game Karaoke Revolution. In this game you have to sing into a microphone and match pitch and rhythm. Most interesting in this song list is the REM song "It's the end of the world as we know it." Now there's a song I want to sing.
