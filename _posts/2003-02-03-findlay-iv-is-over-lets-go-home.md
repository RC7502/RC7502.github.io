RC could have just put that the Findlay tournament was yesterday instead of putting last Sunday but o well. 
<br />

<br />
Fate was against me as I actually won a coin toss, I knew it was going to be a bad day after that one.
<br />

<br />
We did have a big crowd of friends there. Bill, Brittany, Wheeler, Ron, Jim, Matt, Evans, Neoskedar, Drifting Sno, and <A HREF="http://fullofstarz.livejournal.com/">Eryn</A> <A HREF="http://groovemaster.livejournal.com">Ben</A> didn't make it and Kwik's car had died on Friday night.
<br />

<br />
I placed third but am pretty sure Matt could have beat me if we would have actually tried to play. He had a good lupin the third going! He did his Dynamite Rave routine while I [sorta] freestyled on Moonlight Shadow. We ran all our songs on basic :-D haha. Russ was favored to win by everyone I interviewed in the video. I also got some great shots of me spinning in circles with the camera!! :)

The moral of this story is Mocap Boxing WILL hurt your back if you play like I do, and practicing Beatmania IIDX in your dorm for weeks does NOT help your DDR game.
<br />

<br />
I'll see you all at D-town on the 22nd!
