Shortly after I posted my last article my GoWear Fit arrived! It was much quicker than I expected and I didn't even use Amazon Prime. I opened it up and set up my account online. The one I got came with 3 months for free, but you still have to give them a credit card and pick a payment plan:

12 month commitment is $6.95/month
6 month commitment is $9.95/month
Month to month basis is $12.95/month

The software all runs in a web browser and works on either PC or Mac (just a note, it only works on an Intel Mac and you have to use Safari, not Firefox). The device connects through a standard USB cable, just like my phone, PSP and digital camera use. When you launch the software for the first time it asks you standard questions about your age, height, weight, and what your weight loss goal is. It also asks how many calories you consume a day on average. I wasn't quite sure so I went back to The Daily Plate and looked at this month's chart. 2100 calories a day looked to be in the middle. For you goal you can pick how many pounds you want to lose per week, up to two. I picked two pounds a week. Even though it will be harder to do, if I fall short I might still lose one pound a week. Based on that goal it told me my target to burn is 3200 calories per day. There is a nutrition assessment where you can enter your meals for three days and it will use that to calculate your calorie consumption going forward. The only problem I can see with this is if there is a day where I eat way more than I should. I will still be logging my meals and workouts in The Daily Plate so that I can show comparison.

I also got the wristwatch display. This took about 10 seconds to set up. My only minor complaint is that the watchband is kind of dusty/grimy to the touch. Going over it with a damp cloth will help. The display shows you how many calories you burned and steps you've taken for today and yesterday. It also shows the current time, your calorie target, how much time you've done moderate activity, and vigerous activity. At first it showed that I've already burned 880 calories today. I am assuming it estimated my calories burned this morning.

I am really looking forward to working out tonight and seeing how many calories I burn. I will post my results after every few days and after a couple weeks see if I lose any weight.
