Tonight is the Matrix and I couldn't be more excited. I'm hoping this is the "Empire Strikes Back" of Matrix movies. A real "Morpheus frozen in carbonite, Neo gets his hand cut off, finds out Agent Smith is his father" kind of movie. I probably won't even be able to talk about the Matrix Reloaded until next week because I don't won't to ruin it for all the normal people that won't see it till this weekend.
