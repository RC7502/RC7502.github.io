<blockquote><p>The Marvel Comics adaptation, starring Robert Downey Jr. as the guy in the metal suit, hauled in $100.7 million over opening weekend and $104.2 million since debuting Thursday night, the second-best premiere ever for a non-sequel, according to studio estimates Sunday.

<p>It's a very good movie, if you haven't seen it, I'd recommend seeing it before Indiana Jones is released in two weeks! I think the shocking aspect of it's premiere is being the second-best premiere ever for a non-sequel (getting beat out by the original Spider-Man with $114 million). Marvel got a lot of things right to get these numbers, especially since Iron Man doesn't really have the popularity of the masses that Spider-Man has. I guess this guarantees Iron Man 2: The Wrath of Obidiah and Iron Man 3: The Search for Scotch. :-)</p>
