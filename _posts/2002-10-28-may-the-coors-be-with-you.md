The stunts in <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=72>today's comic</a> were performed by cartoon characters. Please try this at home.

So Friday night we went and saw Jackass the movie. Basically it was just like the TV show except with more gross stuff that they couldn't show on TV. What does it say about the movie industry when a guy shooting bottle rockets out his butt is the funniest movie I've seen this year? 4 out of 5 stars.

Saturday I got to see The Ring. It was somewhat interesting but not scary at all. It was boring enough that I wouldn't want to sit through it again. 2 out of 5 stars.

Friday I also got an email from RedOctane saying my Drummania Drum Set should be here in 2-4 weeks. The countdown is on! 26 days remaining.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20021028.gif' alt'' />
