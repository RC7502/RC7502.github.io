Personally I think it has gotten a little <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=461>out of control.</a><br />

The question on everyone's mind (and by everyone I mean geeks, I can't speak for non-geeks but the question on their minds is probably "who is going to win sports?" or "can you believe current events happened?") is "will Episode III be able to live up to the hype?" I for one think it will. The Star Wars fanbase has grown up and it sounds like Lucas has made a more grownup movie. I guess we will see how good it is Thursday. Our podcast Thursday night will be devoted to Episode III and contain major spoilers so don't listen to it until you see the movie, or if you don't care. <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20050516.png'   />
