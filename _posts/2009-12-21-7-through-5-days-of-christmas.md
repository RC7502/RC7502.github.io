Since we had parties to go to on Friday and Saturday we decided to watch 3 movies on Sunday. I decided to stop rating these movies because they were so inconsistent and I really didn't have set criteria I was basing it on.

<strong>Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer</strong>
This is a holiday classic. It's a heartwarming story that says "you should be ashamed and hide anything different about yourself unless your difference can be useful to someone else." Conformity rules! 

<strong>The Santa Clause</strong>
I think this is still a solid movie and worthy of a viewing every Christmas. I pretend there were no sequels. At the time this movie came out Tim Allen was at the height of his popularity on Home Improvement. A lot of the same humor of that show found its way into The Santa Clause. 

<strong>Love Actually</strong>
I had never seen this movie before but Ashley said it counted as a Christmas movie. It is definitely a chick flick but not terrible. There is some nudity thrown in there to make it interesting for guys. Basically the movie follows 162 separate stories played by every working British actor. It works well because none of the stories need a lot of time. 

4 days to go! I seriously regret deciding to write reviews for all these!
