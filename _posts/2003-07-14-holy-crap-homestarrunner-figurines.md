I've mentioned several times that <a href=http://www.homestarrunner.com>www.homestarrunner.com</a> is the funniest site on the internet. Well now you can buy a <a href=http://store.yahoo.com/homestarrunner/horufi1.html>set of figurines</a> of these hilarious cartoon characters. I'm not much of a figurine collector but $30 for 9 characters sounds tempting.
