Bitsmack was my first php programming project and as I look back at my code, most of it sucks. Since I am switching to a new content management system I need to rewrite the video game reviews module. However, a lot of people want me to bring back the comic. I only have so many free hours in a day so I'll leave the decision to you! There is a new poll on the left where you can vote on what project I work on next. That way, if no one votes on the comic you can't blame me for not doing it. The decision is yours.<br />

You have the power...
