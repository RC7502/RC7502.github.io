Friends really focused on great Thanksgiving episodes over the years but they didn't do the same for Christmas. If I had to pick the best Christmas episode of Friends it would be The One With the Holiday Armadillo.

Phoebe's apartment had a fire but it was now repaired. Rachel had been living with Joey and Pheobe was worried Rachel wouldn't want to move back in. Phoebe tried to drive Rachel out by getting Joey a drum set and a tarantula but it backfired. But that part didn't matter any way because Rachel wanted to move back with Phoebe. However, when they get to the apartment it's now only one bedroom instead of two. So Rachel decides to stay with Joey.

Ross had his son Ben for the holidays and he was trying to teach him about Hanukkah. Ben gets upset because they aren't celebrating Christmas so Ross goes on a search for a Santa costume. Instead, he comes home as the Holiday Armadillo. He tries to teach Ben about Hanukkah but then some other holiday characters show up and get in the way.

I thought Friends went downhill after season 5 but this episode is from season 7 and it's pretty good. I give it a 3 out of 5.
