Welcome to K-dog's super busy quick post! Included in this post is new games, and new dvds.
<br />

<br />
1st up: The Games!
<br />
I got Drum mania yesterday making my collection of Bemani PS2 games and Konami brand controllers complete with the exception of the Arcade Stle controllers.
<br />
I purchased TMNT for the GCN and it's a pretty cool beat-em up game! A friend of mine got FFCC imported and I'm hoping to go play that sometime next week.
<br />

<br />
Now it's time for DVDs!
<br />
Aqua Teen Hunger Force is rumored to be releasing a DVD of the first 2 seasons of the popular sunday night Adult Swim Show this November! The 18 episode DVD is sure to be packed full of goodies!
<br />
Also, Aqua Teen Plushies are now on sale at Hot Topic stores everywhere!
<br />

<br />
That's all for now!
<br />
K-dog out!!
