Not a lot happened today.
<br />
I heard SAL beat one of my high scores on DDR at the mall.
<br />
So I beat it but I still need to beat it a few more times to get it off the board. <A HREF="http://cpd.sourceforge.net">CPD</a> (UNIX based DDR sim) is in a pre-alpha state (v0.2) as of Sept. 8th, iCal came out for Mac OS X Jaguar build, and The Scorpion King came out for PS2, GC and Xbox. 
<br />
It's just a really boring week.
