I've been using Mozilla for quite awhile now for all my websurfing needs. But now the latest version of Firefox is my browser of choice. Firefox is like the stripped down, faster version of Mozilla. For those of you that haven't used either one let me give you some of the highlights. 
<br />

<br />
1. Tabbed Browsing - This is the greatest thing to hit internet web surfing since that dancing baby. I pretty sure that baby is 16 now and driving past my condo late at night in his Furious-ed out Honda Civic. Basically tabbed browsing allows you to surf multiple sites at the same time with one browser window. You can be reading one page while another one is loading. It also blocks pop-ups automatically.
<br />

<br />
2. Custom Search Bar - At the top of Firefox is a search bar that you can use to search just about any site you want. I use mine to search ebay, Amazon, IMDB and Google but there are hundreds of other sites that can be added. You could probably use it to look up words like "Furious-ed" on Dictionary.com if you were so inclined.
<br />

<br />
3. Sidebar - You can use the sidebar to look at things like history or your bookmarks, or you can have any other webpage load in the sidebar for quick access. I personally recommend <a href=http://www.flyrt.com>Flyrt.com.</a>
<br />

<br />
4. Extensions - Anyone can write addons for Firefox. If you want to do something Firefox can't do (with the exception of cooking Ramen noodles), chances are someone has already written an extension for that.
<br />

<br />
I highly recommend Firefox for anyone that spends a lot of time surfing the web. You can download it at <a href=http://www.mozilla.org>Mozilla.org.</a>
