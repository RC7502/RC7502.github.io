The fourth DDR tournament was held last Sunday at 6 pm... there were no surviors.
<br />

<br />
The overall champion was Bill, Keaton got second, flippity flippity blah blah blah. More importantly than that are my results. I won my first two rounds like the last tournament, then I lost to Bill. Apparently you don't get extra points for breaking out into freestyle. Keaton videotaped some of the tournament but I wouldn't recommend watching it if you are pregnant or have a heart condition. He also took pictures which will hopefully go up soon.
