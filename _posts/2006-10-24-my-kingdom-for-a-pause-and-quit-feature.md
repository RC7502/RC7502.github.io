I recently picked up Metroid: Zero Mission for the GBA and have been playing through it. For those that don't know,  to save your progress in the game you must locate the "Save Rooms". I don't have a problem with this style of gameplay, in fact, I think it weeds out the weaker players who would just save right before boss battles. The problem arises when you need to put the game down at a moments notice. The Metroid games (and The New Super Mario Brothers game on the DS) allow you to put the machine to sleep, which helps. But in sleep mode you cannot switch games.<p></p>What I want is a "Pause and Quit" feature. Have it work like a save, but it quits your game so you can switch games. That way you can "Pause and Quit" Metroid whenever you would like, but it wouldn't allow you to just save before boss battles. Once you resume after a "Pause and Quit" it doesn't remember the paused information, so you can't return to it if you die.<br>
