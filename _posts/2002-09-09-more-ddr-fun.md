Today's comic comes from the 4 hour DDR marathon Saturday night. It was a good time.
<br />
<br />
Sunday I got to see Bleach in concert in Toledo. Bleach is a really cool band. You should check them out. I just got back from the concert and I am tired. RC sleep now.

Quote of the Day:
<br />
Rumble - Megatron! It's the Autobots!
<br />
Megatron - Impossible, they were doomed!
<br />
ThunderCracker - Don't worry, we'll make them pay for un-dooming themselves.
