I looking forward to Squidfest Saturday because I really haven't played PC games for a couple of years.  I think the reason I don't play as much is that sitting at a computer desk with mouse and keyboard isn't as comfortable as sitting on the couch with a joypad playing a console game. If anyone has suggestions on making PC gaming more comfortable let me know. Anyway, I shouldn't do too bad on FPSs because you don't forget how to play them. I'm going to get hosed on real time strategy games though. Since I haven't played for so long I don't have a good start up routine. I'm not very competitve at games I suck at so it should be a good time.
