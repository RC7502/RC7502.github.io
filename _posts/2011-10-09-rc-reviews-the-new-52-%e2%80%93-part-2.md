Previously in <a href="http://bitsmack.com/wp/2011/10/08/rc-reviews-the-new-52-part-1/">this article</a> I reviewed the DC New 52 and made it through the A titles and Batman. Moving along...

<strong>Birds of Prey</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Black Canary and a couple other girls form a chick super hero team.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Probably not, it wasn't bad, but not really great.

<strong>Blackhawks</strong><br>
What I think is going on: A bunch of boring generic fighters go on a boring generic adventure.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Nope.

<strong>Blue Beetle</strong><br>
What I think is going on: It's not easy being a latino teenager going to a latino high school and you have to deal with all your latino problems in an overly latino way. Did I mention that the hero in this comic is latino? Because they beat you over the head with it.<br>
Will I keep reading it: No. I enjoyed this comic less than the Smallville episode that had Blue Beetle. 

<strong>Captain Atom</strong><br>
What I think is going on: If you give Dr. Manhattan his own comic book it is really boring.<br>
Will I keep reading it: Nah I'll just use this first issue if I ever have trouble sleeping.

<strong>Catwoman</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Batman/Catwoman fan fiction is being published now. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No. I was never a fan of Catwoman before and this didn't change my mind.

<strong>DC Universe Presents</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Deadman is like a depressing version of Quantum Leap. <br>
Will I keep reading it: No, they spend the whole episode talking about how Deadman has to possess people to help them without actually showing him do it.

<strong>Deathstroke</strong><br>
What I think is going on: Deathstroke is like the unfunny, unenjoyable version of Deadpool. <br>
Will I keep reading it: Nope. 

<strong>Demon Knights</strong><br>
What I think is going on: It's like D&D without having to be in a dimly lit basement. <br>
Will I keep reading it: This is a maybe, it was a pretty good book. 

<strong>Detective Comics</strong><br>
What I think is going on: The Joker stars in a remake of the 1997 movie Face Off. <br>
Will I keep reading it: I kinda want to see how this first story plays out. but after that probably not. 

<strong>Flash</strong><br>
What I think is going on: The Flash is a guy who can run really fast. <br>
Will I keep reading it: I think so. There were a couple of action scenes where I don't know what exactly is happening. But I like the character.

Stay tuned for more reviews!
