<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=383>Today's comic</a> is based on this <a href=http://www.10tv.com/news/archive/021004local6990.php?story=021004local6990>news</a> that happened in Columbus yesterday. Am I exaggerating? Possibly, but the media does it all the time.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040211.gif'   />
