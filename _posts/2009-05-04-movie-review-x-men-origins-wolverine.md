Over at IGN there is an <a href="http://comics.ign.com/articles/971/971807p1.html">excellent article</a> listing all the ways that this movie is different than the Wolverine comics, so I will exclude these complaints in my review now. 

X-Men Origins: Wolverine was... meh.

This review is going to be spoiler heavy so consider yourself warned. I plan on going through the movie chronologically and listing my likes and dislikes.

<strong>Wolverine as a kid</strong>
So Wolverine's mom was sleeping around and it turns out Sabretooth and him are brothers. That's pretty cool, maybe you can explore the dynamic of two brothers who are related but still at odds with each other. Oh wait, you're not going to bring up the brother thing for the rest of the movie? Alright have it your way. So they fight in all the major wars together until they kill another officer for some reason. Apparently if you survive your death sentence you get off scot-free.

<strong>Team X</strong>
The best parts of this movie are when other people besides Wolverine and Sabretooth on screen. Team X is lead by Stryker and is made up of Wolverine, Sabretooth, Agent Zero (aka Maverick, although he never displays any of Maverick's powers), Deadpool (but without the mask), Blob (but not fat), Wraith (the poor man's Nightcrawler) and Bolt (the most obscure mutant ever). They track down some adamantium to Africa but Wolverine isn't down with killing innocent people so he takes off.

<strong>Sawing Logs</strong>
Wolverine works as a lumberjack and hooks up with a girl named Silverfox (who is in no way related to the Silver Fox in the comics, so why use the name anyway?). Sabretooth shows up and kills off the girl. Wolverine does one of his dozen screaming up at the sky scenes. 

<strong>Weapon X</strong>
In the comics I always thought Wolverine was a sympathetic character. He was abducted and brutally experimented on, turning him into an animal with no memory. In this movie Logan signs up wholeheartedly so he can have his revenge. It's hard to feel bad for a guy that brought on all his problems himself and is a total idiot that allows himself to get played by an obviously bad guy. My main complaint of the film is that they screwed up Wolverine's origin in the movie entitled X-MEN ORIGINS WOLVERINE!

<strong>Wraith, Blob and Gambit</strong>
Looking for Stryker and Sabretooth, sends Wolverine to Wraith (who can act about as well as a non Will Smith rapper can be expected) and Blob (who is fat now). Next stop is the New Orleans looking set to find Gambit for information. Gambit comes off pretty badass. He throws charged up cards and has a staff, which is all that is necessary to play Gambit. There is an absolutely ridiculous moment where Gambit is on a fire escape and Wolverine chops away at the fire escape like it is a tree. It was at this moment I realized I wasn't watching a movie that someone wrote and instead watching a 10 year old playing with his action figures.

<strong>Ending</strong>
It turns out Sabretooth and Stryker were working together (which we all saw coming). Silverfox is still alive (which means her death was meaningless). Also, there are some mutants captured including Cyclops and Emma Frost. The biggest slap to the face for comic fans is when Stryker gives Deadpool swords in his arms, Wraith's teleport ability, Cyclops's optic blasts and then SEWED HIS MOUTH SHUT! That is correct, for the character known in the comics as "the merc with a mouth" they took away his mouth. It would be the equivalent of making the The Dark Knight and dressing Batman all in white. There's a final battle where Wolverine climbs to the top of a nuclear cooling tower for no logical reason other than it would make the fight scene more visually exciting. After the fight is over and the movie is coming to an end the writer realizes that Logan never lost his memory like he was supposed to so Stryker shot him in the head with adamantium bullets. 

It shouldn't have been this hard to write a Wolverine movie. There's something like 30 years of material to pull from. The story is already written for you. I'm not totally against changing some things from the comic if it makes the story fit better as a movie, but these changes actually made the movie less enjoyable. It was just a series of generic action movie cliches from start to finish with nothing unique or interesting about it. I'm not sorry I watched the film because it was cool to see Gambit on the big screen, and Ryan Reynolds was good as Wade Wilson at the beginning. Unless you're a big X-Men fan you can probably wait for this one on DVD. <strong>RENT IT</strong>
