We pick right up after last episode where Ethan was looking very creepily at Charlie and Claire. But for some reason this becomes a Jack episode. 

On the island: Everyone argues about who knows more about tracking while looking for Charlie and Claire. 
Off the island: Jack turns in his dad for being drunk during surgery.

Jack (and myself) wonders how Ethan could kidnap both Charlie and Claire, but I'm pretty sure he had help from The Others. This episode was pretty weak but we do get a few cool things. First of all I learn that medically speaking if someone stops breathing all you have to do is kick their ass until they regain consciousness. Also, at the end we get to see The Hatch for the first time.
