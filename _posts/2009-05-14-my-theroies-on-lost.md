If you haven't watched the finale yet, or all the seasons the preceded it do that first.

Done now? Ok, let's begin.

At the beginning of the finale we see Jacob and another dude I'll call Evil Jacob (EJ). Jacob is watching the Black Rock come to the island, but EJ doesn't want people coming to the island. Then EJ says he's going to kill Jacob as soon as he finds a loophole. When Ben and Locke go into Jacob's fortress of solitude Jacob says "you found your loophole", implying that Locke is really EJ. My theory is that EJ can take the form of anyone dead, who's body is on the island. That's why they made such a big deal about getting Locke's body on that 2nd flight. EJ has also been taking the form of Christian Shephard, Ben's daughter, Horace, and Claire (I am assuming she was killed in the house explosion when Keamy's people attacked). This reminds me a lot of the last season of Buffy, when the first evil could take the form of anyone who was dead.

EJ manipulated Ben into killing Locke and bringing his body back so that EJ could take the role of leader and be led to Jacob. Apparently EJ couldn't go there himself, either because he didn't know where Jacob lived OR maybe EJ can't kill Jacob directly so that's why he had Ben do it. This would also explain why EJ showed up as Ben's daughter and told Ben to do whatever Locke said. Maybe EJ is also the smoke monster? When the Jacob followers found the cabin the ash circle had been disturbed and they said someone else had been using the cabin. So maybe the ash keeps EJ out. 

When Locke was shot and Richard told him he needed to leave the island and die, it wasn't Locke telling Richard to say that it was really EJ. So EJ has been manipulating people on the island for quite some time. We also saw Jacob appearing in flashbacks of all the main characters so he has also been influencing them, but on a smaller scale (maybe it's an analogy of God enacting minor events to influence humans). The only flashback he didn't appear in was Juliet's and she may very well be dead from falling down the hole. 

We finally got to see Rose, Bernard and Vincent again. They've been living peacefully on the beach for 3 years. We hadn't seen the survivors since the flaming arrow attack so the fact that we only see Rose and Bernard means that either the rest of the survivors are dead or they went off to live in the jungle themselves. Either way, I think this scene was for the writers to get rid of the rest of the survivors and not have to show them any more. My theory is that when the show started there were many survivors so that if any of the main cast left the show they could bring a new person up front. Now that we only have a season to go and no one is going anywhere we don't need the rest of the plane survivors. Are Rose and Bernard the Adam and Eve skeletons we saw in the cave in Season 1?

When Jack was preparing to send the bomb down the well, Miles brought up the point "what if you end up causing the same event you are trying to prevent." This is a very valid argument, especially since it has already happened to Jack once this season. He refused to save Kid Ben and by doing so Ben ended up getting turned into an other. However, I think the writers gave Miles this line to address the fans guessing this online and that Jack has a very real chance of changing history. I also believe Daniel has done his research and if he thinks the past can be changed I think he's right. 

Here are a list of questions I have for the last season:
1. What are the consequences of Jacob being killed?
2. Did Juliet really ignite the bomb, or was the white flash the electromagnetic event?
3. Will Jack and the gang sill be in the 70s? present day? or landing in LAX like nothing ever happened?
4. What's the connection to ancient Egypt?
5. What's the whole story of the Black Rock?
6. Why can't babies be born on the island after a certain point in time?
7. What is in the guitar case Hurley brought to the island?
8. What is the back story of the bandaged face lady? (too lazy to look up her name)
9. Why was Walt special? Will he come into play?
10. Are we going to see any more of the stations on the island?

There are many more mysteries, but these are my main questions. What do you guys think?
