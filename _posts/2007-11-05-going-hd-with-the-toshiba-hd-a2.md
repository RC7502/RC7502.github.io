Last Friday I ventured to Walmart at 7:45am to pick up the <a href="http://www.tacp.toshiba.com/dvd/product.asp?model=HD-A2">Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player</a>. Ninety eight dollars later (plus $30 for Transformers) I was ready to see what the high definition disc formats were all about. Unfortunately, I can sum it up in one word, ho-hum... Now, this isn't the format's fault, I think it is the fact that I've been watching HD on the networks for awhile now, and the HD-DVD picture, while looking very good, isn't any better than what I had been watching on the HD networks. My TV is a Toshiba projection TV running at 1080i resolution, so it's about as good as it can be.

I was hoping for some WOW factor, like I saw when I first started watching in HD, unfortunately, I've been spoiled with HD broadcasts. The other minus is that the player won't upscale DVDs to 1080i over component video cables. I guess I'll need to start planning on upgrading my TV to something with HDMI ports.

Since then I've also picked up Planet Earth. It looks very good, and I'd recommend picking it up if you are looking for something to show off your HD-DVD player and HD set.
