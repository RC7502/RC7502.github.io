If you are planning to attend the <A HREF='http://www.ohiostatefair.com/osf/osf.htm'>Ohio State Fair</A> you might want to check out <A HREF='http://www.gameriot.com/'>Spike TV's Gameriot</A>. 
<br />

<br />
<P>For $5 for 50 minutes or $15 for the whole day, you can compete in games such as Tony Hawk's Underground or Halo, plus play unreleased games such as <A HREF='http://www.lucasarts.com/games/swbattlefront/'>Star Wars Battlefront</A>. It's not all Xbox games. They have a bunch of Alienware PCs set up with games such as Far Cry and America's Army.
<br />
<P>It was pretty cool, including the dancers...
