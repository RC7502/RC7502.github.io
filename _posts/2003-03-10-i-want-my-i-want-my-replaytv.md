Friday I made one of my best purchases yet, the ReplayTV.
<br />
<br />
Not only does it take over the functions of my VCR, (I no longer have to worry about running out of tape, or forgetting to set it) but it also frees up more time for me to work on other projects. If I don't feel like watching TV I can watch my shows later. On weekends when there is nothing on I can watch shows I recorded during the week. Also the network functions are very easy to use. Goz and I have already sent shows back and forth to each other. I highly recommend it to anyone that watches a lot of TV. I can't wait to watch those Cowboy Bebop episodes that are on at like 2am. 
<br />
<br />
For some reason the new comic didn't get uploaded so I'll try to upload it again when I get home from work.

Ok, now <a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=256>it's up.</a>
