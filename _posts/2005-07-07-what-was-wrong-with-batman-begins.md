As you may have heard on last weeks podcast, I was not a fan of Batman Begins. It has been called awesome, a triumph of cinema, and the Batman movie that finally "got it" by so many people. So where is it that I manage to find fault? I've been accused of being hard on this movie because I'm a fan of Superman. No, I didn't like this movie BECAUSE I'm a fan of Batman and the number of  omics I own is second only to the amount of Ultimate Spider-Man comics I own. If you want to read my complaints with the film, click read more, be warned, spoilers are within.
