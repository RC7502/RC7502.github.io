Sega.com is <A HREF='http://www.sega.com/help/online/online.jhtml'>announcing that their online service for Phantasy Star Online and PSO2 will be offline starting October 1st</A>.
<br />
<P>They've also put up a PDF of <A HREF='http://www.sega.com/games/dreamcast/post_dreamcastarticle.jhtml?article=art_dcchecklist'>all 248 games released in the US</A>. I guess I now have a system in which to collect all the games!
<br />
<P>The DC is a great machine, and I wish Sega could've done more with it (and at least they could've released Super Monkey Ball for it). It is currently the newest video game machine I own, mainly because I don't buy machines until they drop to $100. Here's hoping one of the three consoles are at the price level for Christmas (although with the Nintendo deals I could almost convince myself I'm only paying $100 for the console).
