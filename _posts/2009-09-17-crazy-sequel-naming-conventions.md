Steam recently released the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/2103/">Star Wars Jedi Knight series</a> on their game download service and after reading the titles included it doesn't make a lot of sense.

Star Wars: Dark Forces
Excellent game. First person shooter set in the Star Wars Universe.

Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II
Same Style but now you have Jedi powers and the option of using a 3rd person view.

Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith
Expansion pack for the previous game.

Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast
Ok, so does this mean we're on Dark Forces III?

Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy
Eh, let's just give up on numbers all together.

Another series that comes to mind is Call of Duty. According to Wikipedia there are 12 games in the Call of Duty series. It started out simple enough:
Call of Duty
Call of Duty 2
Call of Duty 3

Then they decided to mix things up.
Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
Call of Duty: World at War

Now, they've start doing sequels to their sequels:
Call of Duty: World at War: Final Fronts
Modern Warfare 2 (is it Call of Duty 5 then?)

I'm not saying that every video game sequel needs to have a number, I just think that when you start doing things like this it gets confusing for the consumer.

Question of the Day: What other video game series have messed up numbering or naming schemes?
