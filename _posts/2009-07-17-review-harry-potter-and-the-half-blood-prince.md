Wouldn't it have been cool if the Half Blood Prince turned out to be Prince? Anyway, earlier this week I <a href="http://bitsmack.com/wp/2009/07/15/the-first-five-harry-potter-films-from-someone-who-hasnt-read-the-books/">watched the first 5 Harry Potter films</a> even though I haven't read the books. Here's what I thought about the Half Blood Prince.

It starts out like the rest with Harry in the real world. He's utilizing the skills he learned in his Art of Pimping Skills class to get the digits of a young diner waitress. Just when things are going well Dumbledore shows up and gets in the way by casting "cockus blockimus". Oh Harry will you ever find love?

Over the summer Draco has joined the death eaters (Though I don't know why they are called that, I haven't seen any of them eat death. Maybe when they confront their enemies they exclaim "EAT MY DEATH!", if that was the actual explanation I would be ecstatic.). We also find out that Snape has been working for Voldemort all along. Once school starts the death eaters are trying to break into Hogwarts to kill Dumbledore but can't get past the force fields that were bought off of the Gungans from Star Wars Episode 1.

There's a bunch of relationship stuff in the middle. Hermione wants Ron, Harry wants Ron's sister, they mope over that for awhile. The ending is just like Empire Strikes Back. There's a big revelation, bad things happen, and our heroes look out a window knowing there is a big battle ahead. Seriously, the final frames of Empire and Half Blood Prince are identical.

I don't think I liked this one as much as Order of the Phoenix because there was no great wizard battles, but other than that Half Blood Prince was pretty good. One of my overall complaints with all of the movies is that they try to cram too much stuff in and then never give any one topic adequate screen time. We get a little relationship story and then a small amount of Voldemort's origin and then a tiny bit about Snape and Draco, but it always moves quickly to the next thing. The movies are basically the Cliff Notes version of the books. You get the main plot points but it feels like there is so much more going on that we aren't seeing. 

Now I just have to wait another year till the next one comes out.
