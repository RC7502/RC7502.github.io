Tonight was interesting.  It all started at work.  Same old story, Mac'ing it up.  Then onto my client... Mac'ing it up and after those 2 hours I headed to the mall to DDR it up and meet dave at the movies at 9:45pm.  I got about three games in and ended up spending more time buying stuff and chatting at gamestop than anything else.

A story about Jack Black and Ben Stiller who are best buds working at 3M and it was just as good as the last Ben Stiller movie I saw..... >:()
<br />
I'm officially banning all Ben Stiller movies!!!  I don't care who else is in the movie!!!  Unless he's in Star Wars or a movie about rhythm games I'M NOT WATCHING IT!!  Jack Black was not in the movie nearly enough, the jokes were just dumb, and like every scene had Ben Stiller in it!!! The soundtrack was horrible and the whole movie just needed Ben to off himself.  Jack Black was funny. D-
<br />

<br />
The best part of the movie was when it was over and Berb and I jumped into the theatre to seen the end of Van Helsing!  That was a good movie :)
<br />
Now it's late and I need sleep.
<br />
Goodnight!
