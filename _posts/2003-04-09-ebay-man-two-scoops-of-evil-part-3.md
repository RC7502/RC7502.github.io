I finally decide to get lamps for my computer room and bedroom. When I plug in the bedroom lamp the circuit blows for half the apartment. No power in the bathroom, bedroom or living room.

Using its backlight I am able to see the circuit box and flip the switch to regain power. I owe it all to the GBA! <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030409.gif'   />
