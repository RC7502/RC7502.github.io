Tonight's Christmas movie is How the Grinch Stole Christmas (the good one, not the Jim Carrey one).

For those of you living in a bomb shelter since 1965, How the Grinch Stole Christmas tells the story of a freaky alien town whom also celebrates Christmas and one of the aliens is a dick so he tries to ruin their fun. It's unmentioned whether or not the residents of Whoville (sometimes Whomville) are celebrating the birth of their savior Jesus Who. A quick google search returned zero results on a Dr. Seuss book called "The Passion of Christ Who" so I guess we'll never know.

Anyway, the Grinch is ticked off at the residents of Whoville for having a good time despite the fact he seems to be living in a cave of his volition. He dresses up as St. Nick and steals anything and everything Christmas related out of every house in Whoville. It's quite impressive how thorough he was. He even stole the food and canned marijuana out of their fridges. However, when morning comes and the Grinch prepares himself to delight in their grief, the Whoville people are happy and singing anyway.

The moral of this story is that you don't need material items to be happy. This is so completely the opposite of our consumerized Christmas society today. The animation is so much more bizarre than the cookie cutter computer animation we have now. This is a Christmas classic and I give it a 4 out of 5.
