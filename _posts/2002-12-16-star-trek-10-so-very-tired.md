<br />
So yeah, we went and saw the movie. It was ok. There weren't really any surprises and nothing we haven't seen before in Star Trek episodes. The special effects were impressive. And luckily no one ever "went to manual" (see Star Trek Insurrection). If I were to rank my favorite Star Trek movies it would be as follows:
<br />
<br />
1. II The Wrath of Khan
<br />
2. IV The Voyage Home
<br />
3. VI The Undiscovered Country
<br />
4. First Contact
<br />
5. Nemesis
<br />
6. Generations
<br />
7. III The Search for Spock (only because the Enterprise gets blown up)
<br />
8. and the rest
<br />
<br />
You are free to argue with my rankings. Until next time, live long and prosper.<br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20021216.gif' alt'' />
