Locke and Jack are locking up the guns for safe keeping.

On the island: Sawyer pulls off a long con to get all the guns on the island.
Off the island: Sawyer pulls a long con on a girl he ends up liking. 

There's a connection in this episode where Kate's mom is a waitress at a diner where Sawyer is meeting a guy. Anyway I totally forgot how bad Charlie became for awhile. He was crazy in the last episode, but in this one he is helping Sawyer with a con and attacking Sun.
