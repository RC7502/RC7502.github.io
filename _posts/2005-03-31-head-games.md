Even though I've been sick all week I still managed to <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=455>crank out a comic.</a><br />
<br />
I haven't even played very much Warcraft this week because I've been so sick. I hope I am better by Saturday to go see Sin City. The previews make it look more like a comic than anything I've ever seen.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20050331.png' alt'' />
