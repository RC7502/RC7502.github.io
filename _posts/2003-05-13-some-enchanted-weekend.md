This weekend was rather eventful. If I haven't mentioned it yet, I should have but we now have DDR Extreme (8th Mix) at our local Findlay Village Mall. Also my Beatmania IIDX 6th Style came and Pop N Music 7th should be here this week!!
<br />

<br />
As for the DDR tourney in Defiance, I won! It came down to me, Eric, Bill and Chris. I beat Chris in the final round with three Max2 Roulette songs selected by the tourney hosts.
<br />

<br />
Lastly I would like to say that one of our Bitsmackers will be in correspondance with us during E3 which starts this Wednesday! M-dogg has flown out today to attend the event along with Lee and Peter all from our local Findlay Software Etc store!
<br />

<br />
Matt has agreed to try and post news live from E3 during his week there! Can't wait to hear from you bro!! I have took the liberty of making sure he checks out Konami's DDR setup while there :)
<br />

<br />
That's all for now! <A HREF="telnet://bbs.bitsmack.com"> Do yourselves a favor and get on the BBS</A> there are tons of fun and easy to play games plus you only need to really be on dial-up to access them!!
<br />

<br />
K-dogg out!!
