The episode opens on Claire's eye. She has a dream about her baby being kidnapped and there is a crib on the beach with an Oceanic mobile. She let's out one of the loudest screams I've heard on TV.

On the island: Claire is panicked that someone is going to take her baby.
Off the island: Claire gets knocked up and decides to give up her baby. 

I forgot to mention in the last episode but it was the first appearance of Ethan Rom. In this episode we find out he wasn't on the plane. This episode also gives us the psychic who is adamant that Claire raises her baby herself. He says terrible things will happen if anyone else raises it. I guess he is kinda right. Later on in the series Kate raises Aaron off the island and it causes Claire to go crazy and have bad hair. Psychic powers... CONFIRMED. 

Ashley's note: She wants to know why it was so important that Claire raise the baby. I told her we never find that out.
