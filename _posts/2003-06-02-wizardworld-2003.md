Still no comic, the whole hard drive thing, remember? More on that later.
<br />

<br />
Friday night Goz, TheRogg, and I left at Midnight under the cover of darkness. We arrived in Philidelphia seven and a half hours later. Once the convention started we ran over to the other side of the convention hall to pick up our tickets for the <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Name?Smith,+Kevin>Kevin Smith</a> Q&A. The tickets were free but their neccessity would become apparent later on. We then head over to the <a href=http://www.viewaskew.com>ViewAskew</a> booth, where I picked up the WizardWorld exclusive black and white <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Title?0109445>Clerks</a> figures. During all this time TheRogg was playing in the Raw Deal tournament. 
<br />

<br />
In continuation of our "waiting in line" theme, Goz and I got in line to meet <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Name?Mack,+Allison>Allison Mack</a> from the WB show Smallville. We got our pictures taken with her and got her autograph. She did comment on my Bitsmack.com t-shirt. Of course, I had to promote the site. She was really nice and just as good looking in person. 
<br />

<br />
Afterwards, we finally had time to walk around the convention. I read comics but I admit I'm not as big into it as I used to be. I'm sure if I had a comic/action figure/gaming wishlist I would probably be able to find eveything on it. As we passed the ViewAskew booth again I immediately recognize <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Name?O%27Halloran,%20Brian>Brian O'Halloran</a> (Dante from Clerks), <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Name?Johnson,%20Bryan%20(I)>Bryan Johnson</a>, and <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Name?Flanagan,%20Walter%20(I)>Walt Flanagan.</a> I got pictures of all of them and had Brian sign my Dante figure.
<br />

<br />
The Kevin Smith Q&A started at 3:30 and luckily Goz and I were in line early again because the room filled up quickly. Kevin came out and answered questions similar to his DVD, <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Title?0346952>An Evening with Kevin Smith.</a> I think enough people in the room had seen the DVD because there were very few repeated questions. I can't recount all the questions he answered because it was two hours long, but Smith was just as funny as ever. At the end he did show us two clips of his upcoming movie <a href=http://us.imdb.com/Title?0300051>Jersey Girl,</a> which has now been pushed back to February 2004. In the first scene Ben Affleck and J-Lo are getting ready for something and arguing in a funny way. The second scene had Ben's daughter and a boy showing each other their "stuff". Ben has to sit them down and have a talk. After seeing this clips I have no doubt that Jersey Girl is going to be a funny movie.

Overall it was a great show. I got to see just about everything I wanted to see. I didn't get Kevin Smith's autograph because he signed Friday, but at least I got plenty of pictures at the Q&A. I probably won't get the pictures up until July because I used a one-time camera and need to use up the rest of the pictures at Lakeside.
