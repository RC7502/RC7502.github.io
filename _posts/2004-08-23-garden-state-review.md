Friday night a group of us went out and saw the movie Garden State, starring Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. It was a really good movie. It's not a comedy like Anchorman or Old School with jokes every minute. Instead the laughs come from more belivable characters and situations. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is looking for something better than the typical mindless hollywood crap.
