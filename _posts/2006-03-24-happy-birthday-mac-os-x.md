Mac OS X was released 5 years ago, today! Let's take a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/01q2/macos-x-final/macos-x-1.html">look back at OS X 10.0</a>. It is now up to version OS X 10.4. Windows XP was released in August of 2001, and while Apple has continually improved up OS X, what has Microsoft done? In 5 years we've gotten Service Pack 2 and a beta of IE 7.

If you have not yet taken a look at OS X, please check out <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Apple's pages on all the features offered</a> and then <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/">visit an Apple Store</a> near you.
