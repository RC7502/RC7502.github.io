It's no <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=358>joke.</a> There are a lot of good games out.

I've told myself I won't buy any more games until after Christmas. Except for Ultramix, I bought that yesterday. It's pretty much the same old DDR except that you can play 4 players and play online. I am awesome online (when I use the controller). If anyone else has Ultramix let me know, my gamertag is "chill". If I were to break my rule and buy another game now it would probably be Project Gotham 2. I hardly ever play racing games but the first PG is my favorite. I like racking up kudos points far better than just racing other people.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031121.gif'   />
