A couple of days ago Google announced that they are shutting down Google Reader in July. I was shocked and disappointed. Out of all the apps I use on a daily basis Google Reader was in the top 5. Within hours of this announcement I and many other people were scouring the Interblag to find the next best replacement. Any site that was mentioned as a Reader alternative was pounded with so much traffic some of them couldn't even stay online. What I think is funny about this whole ordeal is that Google Reader never really improved or changed much the whole time it was online and yet no other developers really challenged them or tried to replace them.

Let's look at a little history. 10 years ago I had a list of websites I visited every day. Some of them were web comics, the rest were technology and video gaming news sites. I saved this list as bookmarks and every morning I would open them all up in tabs and and then go down the line seeing if any of them had new content. It wasn't like today when a news site would have dozens of articles a day. There would be a handful of new articles and maybe no new ones at all. It was the worst when a site hadn't been updated because it felt like you wasted your time checking that site. When RSS feeds were invented I jumped on it right away. Instead of checking all these sites every day I could just use a news reader and have the new articles come to me. Google Reader came out in 2005 and I've been using it as my news reader ever since. 

This is what I find so interesting, is that in 8 years I never bothered looking for something new that was better than Google Reader. It did what it needed to do and that was good enough. If I did need a new tweak there were plenty of Chrome addons for Reader that would provide that functionality. Everyone relied on Google Reader so much that when the iPhone blew up in popularity app developers would write news reader programs that tied into Google Reader rather than stand alone. I have a really good app called Reeder and I can't wait to see what direction they are going to go without Google Reader. Apple comes out with a new iPhone every year and it's quite the mind game. I would never think my iPhone had shortcomings until Apple releases a new iPhone that does something new. However in 8 years no one tried to dethrone Google. There have been apps like Flipboard and Feedly that make news reading prettier, but they still use Google Reader as the backend.

Now that I am forced to find a new news reader I do want some new features. Here is my wish list for a new news reader app:
<ol>
	<li>Must be web based so I can check it from any computer.</li>

	<li>I would prefer a free service, but I am not against paying for it if it is amazing.</li>

	<li>Must have an open API so that iOS apps can be written to connect to it.</li>

	<li>It would be really cool if I could sort articles by how popular they are. For web comics I want to read them oldest to newest but for everything else I want to read the big news stories first.</li>

	<li>Must be able to quickly skim through the article list marking things as read as I go. Keyboard shortcuts are encouraged. </li>

	<li>Must be able to save articles to Pocket.</li>
 
 	<li>(Optional) Be able to integrate Facebook news feed and Twitter feed.</li>

</ol>


I don't think I am being too unreasonable and yet I have not found an app that does all these things. Google Reader isn't ending till July so it's just a waiting game to see who is going to rise to the top.
