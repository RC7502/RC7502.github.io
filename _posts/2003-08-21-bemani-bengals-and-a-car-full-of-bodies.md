So this week in <I>"K-dog's World"</i>
<br />
We've got a DDR tourney in Cincy. The Eastgate tournament. RC, Lynex and yours truly will be heading south Friday night to catch some ZZZ's at my aunt's and chill with the DDR crews of cbus, WSU, Cleveland, and Cincy.
<br />

<br />
Findlay tourney is scheduled for Aug 30th with Bemani night being at K-dog's apartment on the 29th. All participants are invited so long as they can get their own transportation to the apartment. The tourney is ending registration at 10:30am and beginning at 12 noon. The entry fee is $5 + pay per game.

In gaming news I preordered XIII for xbox and FFTA for GBA. I've bought no games this week! Go me! I CAN save money!! I've got xbox live in preparation for DDR Ultramix coming in November! Max2 USA comes out in September and Extreme JPN releases in October.
<br />

<br />
I'm most excited about seeing the new TMNT game, Ultramix on Live, and FFTA. I might be able to finish .hack//Mutation since I'm staying away from KOTOR to be able to concentrate on earning money to live instead of just buying things all the time! I'm just rambling at this point....

K-dog out!!
