The big news this week is that Warner Brothers is dropping HD-DVD this year in favor of Bluray. This figures since I just bought an HD-DVD player (the $100 player's Walmart offered before Christmas).

I don't know what to think of this whole HD format war. On one hand, there have only been around a million stand alone high def players sold. The difference is the PS3 and to a lesser extent, the HD-DVD addon for the Xbox 360. They add on quite a few more players, but how many PS3 owners are using it as a Bluray player?

How many people actually have an HDTV setup and are clamoring for something more than what an upsampling DVD player can offer?

Unfortunately for WB, I'm no longer looking at purchasing the five Harry Potter movies on HD-DVD, since I won't be able to get the final two in that format. Maybe once I get a Bluray player... :-)
