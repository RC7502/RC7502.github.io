Yeah I said that I was going to finish up that last storyline but I thought it had a pretty good finish anyway. <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=277>Here's something new instead.</a>

Dance Dance Revolution is essentially a drug. In Japan there are about a dozen mixes and it's all basically the same game. Why do we keep buying the newest version? I don't know. Probably just to play the same game with different songs. Regardless, I am still looking forward to DDRMAX2 coming in the mail this week. Rhythm games have by far become my favorite video game genre. They're simple to learn and easy to pick up and play for a few minutes. I've got another import game on the way too but I'll talk about it more on Wednesday.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20030428.gif' alt'' />
