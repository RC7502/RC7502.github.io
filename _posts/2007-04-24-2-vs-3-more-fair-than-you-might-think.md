After missing last week because of my stupid career, I was back in Gears of War on Tuesday Night Live. We started out 2 on 2:

Game 1 winner: chill, kruton7
Game 2: chill, The Berb
Game 3: Daddykin, The Berb

Then Deniolan joined in and we played The Berb and kruton7 vs. the other 3.

Daddykin, Deniolan and chill won 2
The Berb and kruton7 won 1

Deniolan got disconnected during one game and came back on the other team. Obiviously they crushed Daddykin and chill. Because kruton7 made it an open game some random dudes joined in the last game. The four of them definitely killed our army of 3.

Notable honors:

Daddykin playing Robin Hood with the torque bow.
The Berb trying out every humiliating way to kill an opponent, including grenade tagging.
The team of 3 accumulating their points to win while there was a lag message on the screen.
3 or 4 people getting taken out by the train at the same time.
