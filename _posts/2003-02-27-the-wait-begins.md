Only 3.5 hours till I head out to the mall to play DDR and pick up Xenosaga. Tomorrow's the concert and there's not much else going on. Ironically our network is lagging for PCs but Macs are working just as good as ever! Score one for OS 10.2.4!! I still have my XP box for gaming tho. I'm doubting that will ever change. If you're bored message me.
