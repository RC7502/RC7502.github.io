<a href=modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=255>Today's comic</a> is based on an almost weekly discussion Goz and I have. 
<br />
<br />
The world of gaming has been pretty boring lately. If you need proof read the last 2 comics on <a href=http://www.penny-arcade.com>Penny Arcade.</a> All I have is Timesplitters 2 to hold me over until the new Game Boy Advance and Zelda come out later this month.

We've got a few nominations for comics to be featured on the Bitsmack, but we need more. If you'd like a tshirt of your favorite comic, click "comments" below.
