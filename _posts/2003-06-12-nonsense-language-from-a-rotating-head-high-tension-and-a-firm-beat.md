This is from the song Daikenkai from Pop N' Music and DDR Extreme.
<br />
I'm totally in love with that song.

<B>Defiance tourney</B>
<br />
Defiance was a lot of fun! We had a good turnout and I met the Parma crew and a guy from BG who plays. <A HREF="http://www.livejournal.com/~djstunna">Parma Steve</A> taught us all how DDR is played in P-town by winning the whole tourney and demonstrating the correct way to pass Max UNlimited Extra Stage. It was great meeting trancestep, ralic and DJ Stunna!! Can't wait for the Parma tourney!! ;)
<br />
The results were like this:
<br />
Steve - 1st
<br />
Bill - 2nd
<br />
Me - 3rd
<br />
Chris - 4th

<B>This weekend</B>
<br />
So Rc and I are headed south this weekend to hit the <A HREF="http://www.ohioddr.com">MME 2 tourney</a> and chill with <A HREF="http://mmr.bemanistyle.com">DJ Paranoia</A> before he leaves for TN next week. I never knew there a huge Bemani freak right here in Ohio let alone that he runs a site I visit almost daily known as <A HREF="http://www.bemanistyle.com">Bemanistyle</A>!!

In other news I bought Castlevania Aria of Sorrow and got the last copy of it in Kay-bee at Defiance. Plus I got FF1 for NES which completes my FF console collection.
