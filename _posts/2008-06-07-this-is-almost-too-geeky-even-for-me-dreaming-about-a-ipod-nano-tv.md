For some reason last night I had some very vivid dreams, to the point where I actually remember parts. During my dream, for some reason, I had ordered an iPod Nano. Yes, apparently my dreams are as exciting as real life. The Nano I received was different. It was the same size as the current Nanos, but the entire front was the screen, and it was a touch screen, no scroll wheel in sight. The manual called it a Nano TV (it must've been a dream since I don't read the manuals in real life). <br /><br />Anyway, it was a pretty nifty device, and I'm sure Apple is moving in that direction.<br />
