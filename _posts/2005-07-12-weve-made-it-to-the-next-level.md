The <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=73800498'>Bitsmack Podcast has made it to iTunes!</a> (link only works if you have iTunes 4.9 installed).<br />
<br />
Clicking on it will let you subscribe to the Bitsmack Podcast through iTunes and it will automatically download new shows as we put them up. I'll need to make a button with the link to let people easily subscribe to the podcast.
