If I haven't mentioned it before I am a statistics junkie. When I run I have a log of my distance ran, time, and heart rate. I keep track of my finances and budget in spreadsheets. I can roughly tell you what my bank account balance will be 3 months from now. When it comes to video games I've been using <a href="http://raptr.com/chill182">Raptr</a> to track time spent playing games and my achievements. However it doesn't quite give me all the information I want. I starting using <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> to make notes about the game I was playing. I would make a list of all the levels in the game and then cross them off as I go. It's nice to know whether I am getting close to beating a game or not. 

Then I thought it would be cool if I could see a progress bar for every game I'm playing and rank them by % complete. Most newer games provide a % complete so they were easy to put into a spreadsheet. For the ones that don't have that I would simply look up the game on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com">GameFAQs,</a> find out how many levels there are, and figure out the percentage that way. In my Google spreadsheet I have 6 columns:
A. Game Name
B. % complete (D/E)
C. % remaining (1-B)
D. # of Tasks complete
E. Total # of Tasks
F. Last Played (date)

I entered in the last 20 games I've played and then created a sideways stacked bar chart based on Columns A through C. I sorted the list by B descending so that the most completed games were on top. Here's what I ended up with:

Some of the XBOX 360 games are based off of number of achievements remaining and some are based on number of levels left to beat story mode. It's really up to you to define what you consider "completing the game". I put the Last Played date on there so that if I haven't played a game in long time I'll take it off the list. If you're really into statistics like I am or maybe you just need motivation to beat a game you've been struggling with, this is something you can set up in about 5 min and access from any computer with an internet connection.
