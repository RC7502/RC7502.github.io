<a rel="attachment wp-att-2119" href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2011/01/21/meeting-the-king/donkykong_13/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2119" title="Logan Hardware - Chicago, IL" src="http://dl.bitsmack.com/uploads/2011/01/donkykong_13-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Last week was Goz's birthday and one of the ideas he threw out was "hey Steve Wiebe is going to try and beat the Donkey Kong record in Chicago." We figure out it was only going to be a 6 hour drive so hey why not. Friday night we stayed out late partying and then was on the road at about 7am Saturday. We got there in the early afternoon. The event was at this place called Logan's Hardware which it turned out was not a hardware store, nor owned by Wolverine. The front area was a record store just like in High Fidelity. It was the most hipsteriest place I've ever been. I've never seen more guys with shaggy hair, beards and large 70s glasses in all my life. In the first back room there were classic arcade games set up on free play. These machines were in very good shape, not like the beat up crap you find at most arcades. They had games like Track and Field (my favorite), Tempest, Missile Command, Food Fight, Empire Strikes Back, Gauntlet II, Marvel vs. Capcom, Tron, and several more.

Even through the classes were sold out some people didn't show up and Goz and I got the last 2 seats. Steve went through each one of the Donkey Kong screens and gave basic strategies for completing the screens as well as tricks to rack up extra points. He did some Q&amp;A as well which was pretty interesting.

Then it was time for the record attempts to start. Earlier in the week Steve's previous world record was beaten by someone else so there was more on the line in attempting to reclaim his crown. When the first attempt started the place was packed. It was standing room only and they had video projected on the walls for everyone to watch. Lots of people came through not really knowing what was going on. After about an hour people started to leave. I guess watching someone jump over barrels that long isn't exciting to most people. <a rel="attachment wp-att-2120" href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2011/01/21/meeting-the-king/img_20110115_182738/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2120" title="IMG_20110115_182738" src="http://dl.bitsmack.com/uploads/2011/01/IMG_20110115_182738-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>A couple of hours in Steve was on level 19 out of 21 and got game over. By that time it was after 6pm and Goz and I were ready to go home. I found out later Steve's other attempts didn't get as far as that first one. Goz and I arrived home around 1:30 am. It was a long day.

Overall it was a pretty good time. I am glad we got into the Q&amp;A or else the trip might not have been worth it. Also, there was a crew there filming a new documentary (King of Kong 2?). So when that comes out you might see us in the background.
