Wow, it's been so long since I posted but I have lotsa stuff to say. I did compete in a few Dance Fever Competitions and have not won. Eddie, DJP from <A HREF="http://www.bemanistyle.com">Bemanistyle</A> did however win the comp in Detroit. 
<br />

<br />
I have acquired a few new toys like Keyboard Mania, Guitar Freaks, and the new Pop N Music 8. I finally completed Mega Man Battle Network and have moved on to the sequel. 
<br />

<br />
In life I went to WWDC in CA which I mentioned earlier, I've been working like a fiend and another reason for my absence is that I am serving as an RA for Ohio Business Week here on the U of F campus. In other related news my main PC is down due to HD failure. I mainly been playing Pop N Music 8 and working since the issue. Unfortunately I doubt I will be up before next week. Lastly, a friend of mine is giving me her prize of a year's supply of Mt. Dew for some old DDR equipment!! My metal pads are junk and I hope to rewire them soon using an official PSX controller.
<br />

<br />
Other than that, I'm going out to play some euchre with the guys and eat pizza :)
<br />
K-dog out!!
