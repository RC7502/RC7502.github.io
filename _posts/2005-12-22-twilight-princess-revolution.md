<a href="http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=5921">This article</a> provides an interesting tid-bit about the delay of Twilight Princess until Mid Spring 2006.

<strong>From the article:</strong> "But, perhaps the biggest reason for the delay has now been revealed by NGC, a UK magazine - Twilight Princess "will be playable on the forthcoming Revolution using the upcoming console's unique controller." It's still coming out on GameCube, but when the disc is inserted into the Revolution, you'll be able to play it using the Rev's remote. "

This should make the games controls interesting to say the least.
