Other than a few <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=346>minor complaints,</a> iTunes for Windows is pretty good.

This week I decided to pack up the Dreamcast. I came to the conclusion that I haven't played it or even had it hooked up since I moved here in January. It's not that I don't like the system, it's just in the "yesterday's news" catagory. It's not new enough to keep up with the big 3, and it's not old enough to be a classic. In its place the SNES has graduated to the living room.

Here's to you Dreamcast... until we meet again.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20031022.gif'   />
