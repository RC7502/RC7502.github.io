<a href=http://www.gamesdomain.co.uk/news/9193.html>GamesDomain</a> has reported that Earthbound 1 and 2 will be coming on a single cartridge for the GBA. A never before released Earthbound 3 could be coming later this year. This should be great news for Bitsmack fans as I know Earthbound is a favorite around here.
