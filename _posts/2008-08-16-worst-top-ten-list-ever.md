<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/photos/collections/gallery/970/yahoo-users-toprated-scifi-films#photo0">Yahoo! Users Top-Rated Sci-Fi Films</a><br /><br />I'm not going to ruin what they ranked as #1, suffice to say that it is a very good movie but not the #1 Sci-fi movie of all time. Notable absenses include:<br /><ul><li>Any Star Trek movie</li><li>Blade Runner</li><li>2001: A Space Odyssey</li><li>Forbidden Planet</li><li>The Day the Earth Stood Still</li></ul>And there are way too many X-men movies in the list. (Correct number of X-Men movies that should be in the top 30 Sci-Fi films of all time: 0).<br />
