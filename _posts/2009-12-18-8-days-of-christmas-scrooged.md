This is the 3rd version of a Christmas Carol we've watched and it is the funniest. The movie has one of the best opening sequences you can have: Lee Majors with a Gatling gun protecting Santa from a bunch of dudes on snowmobiles with automatic weapons. I don't think anything in the rest of this Bill Murray is a TV executive and the Scrooge-like character, but at least he's funny when he's mean to people.  He's visited by his old boss (aka Marley) who looks like a pretty convincing zombie. Murray's old girlfriend shows up, who is also Indiana Jones's girlfriend so this is a big step down for her. Also, Murray is worried he is going to lose his job to Lex Luthor's dad.

What can I say, the three ghosts came and showed Bill Murray his past, present and future. Once he changes in to a good guy at the end it's pretty funny to watch. Overall, it wasn't as hilarious as I remember it but Bill Murray is still really funny throughout. I'll give it a 3 out of 5.
