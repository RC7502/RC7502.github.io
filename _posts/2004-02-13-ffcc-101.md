This <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=384>comic</a> is based on a conversation I had with Goz when I tried to convince him how cool Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is. 
<br />

<br />
Now I have the attention span of a bobblehead doll but I will still try an RPG if I find that the battle system is enjoyable. I don't think I've ever seen Goz play an RPG but he does have a valid reason. It's hard to just pick up a game like FF and play for a few minutes and then walk away. First you have to remember what you were doing last, then you have to find a save spot when you want to quit. If you've never played an RPG before and want to give it a try I recommend the following titles:
<br />

<br />
- Chrono Cross (PS1)
<br />
- Paper Mario (N64)
<br />
- Mario & Luigi (GBA)
<br />
- Knights of the Old Republic (XBOX)
<br />

<br />
I think these are the best RPGs for newbies with Chrono Cross being my favorite RPG of all time. 
<br />

<br />
What do you guys think about RPGs?
