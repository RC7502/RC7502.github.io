We're trying a new way of recording ourselves and have uploaded a couple of podcasts. What's a podcast? <a href='http://www.ipodder.org/'>Head on over to ipodder.org and find out</a>.<br />
<br />
<p>If you subscribe to the site's RSS feed with iPodder it will automatically download new shows and place them in your iTunes in their own playlist.<br />
<br />
<p>RC and I did one last night, and you can listen to it <a href='/dl/20050302.mp3'>here</a> (6.2MB) or subscribe to the Bitsmack RSS feed <a href='http://www.bitsmack.com/backend.php'>here</a>.
