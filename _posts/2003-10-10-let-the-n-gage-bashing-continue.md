<p>In going along with the <a HREF='http://www.n-gage.com/'>N-Gage</a> bashing for this week comes <a HREF='modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=342'>this comic</a>.
<br />
</p><p>And if you have nothing better to do with your time, check out the <a HREF='http://www.n-gage.com/'>N-Gage</a> website. There is a worthless TV ad that goes through various   locations where the owner of a N-Gage got the "smackdown" on himself. And you can download <a HREF='http://www.n-gage.com/downloads/extras/wallpapers/800x600_road.jpg'>worthless wallpaper</a> with appropriate sayings....
<br />
</p><p><a HREF='http://www.n-gage.com/downloads/extras/wallpapers/800x600_road.jpg'>And this is where I cried for help.</a> Say what?
