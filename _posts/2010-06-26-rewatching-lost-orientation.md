We open with Michael, Sawyer and Jin getting beaten up and shoved in a hole. Then we go back to the standoff with Jack and Desmond that we've seen 3 times now. 

On the island: Locke and Jack argue over whether or not to push the button. 
Off the island: Locke chooses stalking his dad over dating Leela from Futurama.

Locke meets Helen at the support group meeting. Helen was the name he called the phone operator in Walkabout. This episode is supposed to be the big Faith vs. Science debate. But arguing over whether or not to press a button is stupid. They both watched the video that talked about how important it was to press the button. There is no evidence that pressing the button won't prevent a disaster. So its not faith, its not science, its just common sense. 

Elsewhere on the island we find out Sawyer, Michael and Jin were captured by the tail section, not The Others.
