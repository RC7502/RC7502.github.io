I'm back! In order to make up for last week I am doing 5 comics this week starting with <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=377>this one.</a>
<br />

<br />
This was a pretty eventful weekend. I put in an offer on a house and it got excepted so I'm moving at the end of February. Yesterday was also Ohayocon in Columbus. It was kind of cool. Also, K-Dog had a DDR tournament so maybe he'll post how that went.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040126.gif' alt'' />
