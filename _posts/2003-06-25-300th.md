After I uploaded the <A HREF='modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=300'>comic for today</A>, it came back as the 300th entry in the database... Unfortunately, this is only my 4th. We'll have to change that for the next 300 comics!<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20030625.gif' alt'' />
