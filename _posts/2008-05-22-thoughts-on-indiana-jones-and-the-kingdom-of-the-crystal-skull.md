It's not that it's a bad movie, I enjoyed it, it just seemed like a standard adventure movie and they threw Indiana Jones in as the protagonist.  It also didn't feel right, and the problem was that he hadn't been updated for the '50s. The three previous movies took place in the '30s, and Indy looked the part. In the 1957, he just appears totally out of place, an anachronism if you will. The fedora would have to stay no matter what, but the rest of his outfit just looked out of place. This was a common complaint when the TV show The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones was on TV, placing Indy in current times telling stories of the past.

And, btw, don't listen to any reviewers saying that the CGI detracted from the movie. I was afraid that was going to happen, and was pleasantly surprised when it didn't appear too much out of place.

And apparently Indy has quite a life in the 20 years after Last Crusade, becoming some sort of war hero. They've turned his life into some sort of Forrest Gump, even RC said that he can't wait for the next one where Indy is helping with the moon landing.
