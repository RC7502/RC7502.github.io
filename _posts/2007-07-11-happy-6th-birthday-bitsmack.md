Much like renewing your drivers license or your child's birthday, sometimes an important date goes by without you realizing it. Last Thursday marked 5 years since the first <a title="Bitsmack comic" href="http://bitsmack.com/comics/2002/07/05/the-bt-smackers-comic-is-online/">Bitsmack comic</a>. You know, back then I never imagined the website being more than a summer hobby and it's hard to believe 5 years have gone by. I went back and read some of those early comics and even though some are dated they are still good for a chuckle. I think I want to get back into doing the comic on a regular basis. If I set a day that I'm going to do a comic then that will force me to do it more often.
