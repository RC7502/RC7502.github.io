Kate sees a black horse in the jungle. Is it the smoke monster??

On the island: Kate thinks the ghost of her dad is after her. 
Off the island: Kate exploded her dad. 

They finally got Jin's handcuff off so that's not bothering me anymore. In this episode we see the orientation video again, but this time Mr. Eko has the missing frames in a Bible. In the rest of the series I don't believe they ever explain who took out these scenes and why they put them in a Bible on the other side of the island. I totally forgot that Kate finds out the man she murdered was her actual father. We find out the missing piece of the film warns people not to use the computer to try to contact the outside world. Just then, Michael gets an instant message from what could be Walt. 

Ashley's note: She likes that Ana Lucia was not really in it.
