I wonder which came first, Frosty the song or Frosty the cartoon. A trip to wikipedia could answer this for me but who has the time?

It's weird that the kids gave Frosty arms and legs. Most snowmen I see are just three balls on top of each other. There's not much to this plot other than adults being freaked the hell out by Frosty and kids following him blindly. Frosty has to get to the north pole because global warming caused summerlike temperatures to occur a mere 15 min after he was made. One girl decided to risk hypothermia by tagging along. When she gets too cold Frosty sacrifices himself to get her some place warm. But it isn't much of a sacrifice because Santa shows up and brings Frosty back to life. There's also the magician trying to get his magic hat back but he's pretty pathetic. If this seems like a pretty short story it's because they sing Frosty the Snowman no less than 14 times throughout the show. 

Overall I think basing a cartoon on a song with like 5 lines is a pretty bad idea. I give a 4 to the song and a 1 to the cartoon so that averages out to 2.5 out of 5 stars.
