A side project I've been working on for a couple of months is now ready for others to beta test and tell me what's working and what's broken.

<a href="http://budgetxl.com/">BudgetXL</a> is designed to help you keep track of all the cash purchases (or credit card and other purchases if you want) that you do during a day. It has an email interface that you can use from your favorite email account or through text messaging (which is how I use it). There is more information on the website. Most cell phone providers provide a text messaging to email interface that you can use from your phone. For example, under Verizon, I can just put the email address in as the recipient and it sends the email.

If you get a chance, try it out at <a href="http://budgetxl.com/">http://budgetxl.com/</a> and let me know of what issues you see and what can be improved. When you sign up you'll need to use the code "bitsmack" (without the quotes).

Thanks for the help!
