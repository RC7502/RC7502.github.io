In this episode Jack and Sawyer fight over who's going to take Kate to the dance while she's more worried about beating out Shannon for Queen. Oh wait, it's not that kind of Homecoming. Anyway, Claire is back in town but she doesn't remember anyone. "Bullocks! I'm going to have to start all over on chatting up Claire" Charlie thinks to himself. 

On the island: Charlie shoots Ethan a lot as a way to take care of Claire.
Off the island: A girl Charlie tries to scam tells him he'll never take care of anyone.

So it's free gun day on Lost Island to the first 5 people that want to go after Ethan. The posse catches Ethan and Jack beats him for the good part of 45 min before Charlie finishes the job. There's also a nice Office reference in the flashback when one of the girls says her dad is buying a paper company in Slough. 

Ashley's note: the shots fired into Ethan were badass.
