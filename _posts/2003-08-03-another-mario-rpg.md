Nintendo is making another Mario RPG. First they made Super Mario RPG. Then they made Paper Mario. Now they're making Mario and Luigi. 
<br />
Mario and Luigi is for the Gameboy Advance and is being released this November. You control both Mario and Luigi. Unfortunately, it's only a one player game. You control Mario with the A button and Luigi with the B button.
<br />
If this game is anything like Paper Mario, it will be a great game. And now that I own a Gameboy Player for my Gamecube, I'll be able to play Mario and Luigi on my 19 inch television.
<br />
If you're an RPG fan, a Mario fan, or a Paper Mario fan, you should consider buying Mario and Luigi.
