<strong>Family Guy - A Very Special Family Guy Freakin Christmas</strong>
I don't know why Family Guy doesn't do more Christmas episodes, this one is pretty great. Peter accidentally gives away all the family's presents while Stewie plots to take down Santa Claus. Peter misses his favorite Christmas special "KISS Saves Santa" in order to buy new presents. "Everyone knows that pterodactyls can't stand the screech of a guitar". 

<strong>12 Men of Christmas</strong>
This is a TV movie on Lifetime starring Kristin Chenoweth. Kristin plays a business exec type that finds out her fiance is cheating on her with her boss. She decides to leave the city and take a job in Montana for a year. Oh no, you don't have a Kinkos or a Gap? How will the city girl survive? Kristin finds out their search and rescue squad is in desperate need of money so she comes up with the idea of selling a calendar with naked pictures of guys. I have to side with the main guy who thinks its a terrible idea. 

That main guy is like a jerk for half the movie and then suddenly changes to a nice guy with no explanation whatsoever. The calendar comes out and is a success. Kristin moves back to New York, but has flashbacks to her time in the "wilderness". I always think its odd when a TV show or movie that isn't very long has flashbacks to things that just happened not that long ago. She finally goes back when the jerky guy has a "bad accident". In actuality he had like a twisted ankle. And like all chick flicks they live happily ever after.
