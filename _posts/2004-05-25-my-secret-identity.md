<a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=416>Today's comic</a> is inspired by all the comics I've been reading lately. Well actually there was just two, and one kinda sucked.
<br />

<br />
I'm trying hard to decide what direction to go with the comic so I'll leave it up to you the viewer. Should I do one shot comics about video games, movies, whatever, or should I do longer superhero type storylines? 
<br />

<br />
Also, I did a physical inventory of the 1st ever special edition Bitsmack T-shirts and found that there are only 18 left, 9 large and 9 x-large. If you ever considered buying one you should do it now because once they're gone, they're gone for good. While I may do more Bitsmack shirts this design won't be made again.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040525.png' alt'' />
