Guess what, I'm done for he summer!!! I can't believe I finished my last finl today!! I have nothing really to add to that! We're going for a DDR celebration party tomorrow with my bro's Eric and Matt up north, I'm pickin up my Max2 copy!
<br />

<br />
<I>NEWS FLASH:</i> DDRMAX 2 has <B>Paranoia Survivor </B>from DDR Extreme as an unlockable!!
<br />

<br />
More over, I ordered DDR metal pads as <A HREF="http://www.buynshop.com">Buy N Shop</A> is running a special deal for 10 days only with metal BNS Extreme pads for $100 ea! For more information check out <A HREF="http://www.bnsusa.com">BNS USA</A>
