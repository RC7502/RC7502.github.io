With the new year approaching I decided to take a look back at the comics of 2005. Here are my 5 personal favorites, though I didn't include the Part of the Team storyline or the Christmas comic because they just went up recently.

<a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/wp/?p=596">My â€œHa Haâ€ Funny Valentine</a>
<a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/wp/?p=600">The Game</a>
<a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/wp/?p=631">Commencement</a>
<a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/wp/?p=651">How I spent My Summer Vacation</a>
<a href="http://www.bitsmack.com/wp/?p=709">Second Opinion</a>

If you have a favorite that isn't listed here, post a link in the comments section.
