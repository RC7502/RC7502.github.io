<P>This <A HREF='http://www.smartmoney.com/bn/ON/index.cfm?story=ON-20030228-000011-0027'>article on Smartmoney.com</a> discuss the possibility of Microsoft and EA both making a bid on Sega.
<br />
<P>Oh how the might have fallen. Who would've though 5 years ago that Sega would be in danger of going under! I think they were just a little a head of the curve with the DC. They should've waiting 6 months and put a DVD drive and more ram in it. I really enjoy my DC, and the graphics still hold up to what is released today. 
<br />
<P>Oh well, back to <A HREF='http://bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Game_Ratings&file=index&action=game&gameid=2917'>Conker's Bad Fur Day</a>.
