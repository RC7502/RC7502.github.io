Yes, RC and Goz went and had a blast but I stayed in the fray, fighting the arrows of DDR and whatnot here at home. I'm totally excited about a few new games around the corner like the 2 new DDR's and the new turtles game coming out for all 3 platforms!! I've got them reserved! Half-life 2 looks simply amazing and FF: Crystal Chronicles looks incredible but was delayed in Japan which mean longer for us to wait as well. I was impressed to see playable Halo 2 and can't wait to start drooling over FF Tactics Advance!
