Here we go another old movie. At least this one is in color. Hey this one has Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye, I think Clark Grizwold said something about them. Ok so Crosby and Kaye meet when they're in the war together. They put on shows for their fellow troops. After the war they start performing together as a singing duo and become quite famous because the internet hadn't been invented yet. Kaye is like the wingman and he's always trying to get Crosby some action. They go check out a new act of two sisters and help the girls evade the police by performing in their place. What I don't get is when the guys go out and perform the song "Sisters" it's still the girls' voices. Does that mean the sisters always lip sync their shows? If I was a patron there I would be pissed!

The two guys and two girls go to a small resort in Vermont for the holidays but there's no snow. Also the resort is owned by the guys' commanding officer in the Army. They decide to put on some shows there to help business. And then like Kaye pretends to be engaged to one of the girls to trick Crosby and the other girl into hooking up or something. I wasn't really paying attention after awhile. At then end all the Army guys come out to the resort and surprise the old general. 

If it seems like a short movie, it's not. There's like 20-30 singing/dancing numbers in there. Overall it still wasn't at bad movie. I'll give it a 3 out of 5.
