Yes yes, I have Beatmania IIDX 5th Style now who wants to touch me?
<br />

<br />
So I've spent the past 3 days playing Beatmania IIDX 5th style and I STILL can't pass anything above a 3 star in Light 7 key difficulty mode!!
<br />
This is the hardest game I have ever played!
<br />

<br />
In other news Thanksgiving break is upon us here at Findlay and I will be returning back to K-town on Wednesday morning. Plus RC's b-day is on Friday and we're having a party!! My basement, friday night, if you want to come ask me for directions on AIM or PM me. If you need a ride, I guess you're not coming.
<br />

<br />
Also Kenton is going to state Div 4 football tourney again so Kenton will be barren on that night, looting may commence soon after.
<br />

<br />
That's all for now, lata.
<br />

<br />
K-dog out!!
