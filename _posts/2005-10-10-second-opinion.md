In space, no one can hear you laugh.

So last weekend Brad got the idea that we should all play Starcraft online. I had never played it, and didn't even own it. A quick trip to Target and $19.99 later I was good to go. The game is a lot different than Age of Empires 2 which is the only RTS game I have spent a lot of time with. After getting schooled by Brad a few times I decided I need to practice. It would be nice to get some other people to join us. Maybe we'll schedule a Bitsmack Starcraft day in the near future.
