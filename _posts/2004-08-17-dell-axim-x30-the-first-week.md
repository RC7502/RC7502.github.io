I haven't had a working PDA for a couple of years now, the last one I had was the original Handspring Visor. This time I decided to get a <a href=http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/axim_x30_high?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs>Dell Axim X30</a> for work reasons. Who am I kidding, I got it for games and wireless internet. Anyway, the first week of working with this new handheld was not exactly pain free. Here is my first week with the Pocket PC.
<br />

<br />
The Axim is a little bigger than my Visor and comes with an uncomfortable leather slip case. I wish I could find a simple snap on cover like my Visor had. Since the Axim has built in 802.11b and Bluetooth my first task was web surfing. I was able to connect to my wireless router really easily and start surfing in a couple minutes. You can switch to horizontal view and reading web pages isn't too bad. 
<br />

<br />
Next, I decided to sync it with my computer. To connect to a Mac you have to buy a third party program so I decided to use my HP laptop instead. When I entered the CD the install menu told me I had to install Flash player even though I already had Flash player installed. I ended up having to run the setup files straight off the CD. It may have been a problem with my laptop but what is the point of making someone install Flash just to install Pocket PC software? Once I was able to sync through the USB cable I then tried to sync wirelessly. This was the most difficult thing I've done yet. There is no documentation on how to do this so I had to read through forums to figure it out. I had to download the freeware programs Pocket Hosts and Total Commander but once I finally got it working I could sync wirelessly and transfer files with any of my computers.

<br />
I haven't got a lot of games yet. Monopoly is my favorite and runs beautifully. The only problem is that the program would end if you tried to go widescreen and I had to do a soft reset to start Monopoly again. This is a minor complaint since there is really no reason to go widescreen anyway. Another great game is Worms World Party. This one you have to play widescreen and it looks just as good as the Dreamcast version.

<br />
I tried out VNC but it ran way to slow on Pocket PC. I also installed Flash player for Pocket PC so I can watch Homestar Runner from anywhere in the house. Internet Explorer could use some extra features. You can't click a link and choose Save Target As. This meant I couldn't download a picture off the internet I could only view it. 
<br />

<br />
All my complaints aside it is a pretty nice machine. It handles all of my calendar/task/address book needs. Pocket Excel is pretty cool and looks good in widescreen. If you are looking for a Pocket PC and want wireless internet I recommend the Dell Axim.
