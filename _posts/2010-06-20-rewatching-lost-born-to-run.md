We open on a blond woman switching her license plates and dying her hair. We're supposed to think this is Claire but it is obviously Kate. 

On the island: Kate wants to get off the island because she's always on the run.
Off the island: Kate being on the run got her friend killed. 

This episode is all about people on the show finding out things the audience already knew. Everyone found out Kate was a criminal. Michael found out Walt burnt down the raft. Sun poisoned Jin to keep him from leaving but Michael drank it instead but then Sun said it was Kate's idea. There is also a weird scene where Locke touches Walt and Walt freaks out and tells Locke not to open it. We never do find out if Walt has psychic powers. 

Ashley's note: In a previous episode Kate said the toy plane belonged to the man she loved, the man she killed. Ashley was relieved to find out it belonged to this Tom guy and not Kate's step dad.
