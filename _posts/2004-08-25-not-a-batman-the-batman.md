Over at the WB you can check out a <a href=http://kidswb.warnerbros.com/web/stuff/stuff_display.jsp?id=BTM>preview</a> of the new Batman cartoon. I can't really tell a lot from the preview except that Bruce Wayne looks younger and the animation style looks pretty freaky. It's starting September 11 on WB.
