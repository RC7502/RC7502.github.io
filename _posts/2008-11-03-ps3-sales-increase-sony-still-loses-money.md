For a company that can proudly post that the <a href="http://news.punchjump.com/article.php?id=6981">PS3 sales increased 86 percent in year over year tallies, it's got to smart that quarterly profit still fell 72 percent</a>. And to rub a little salt in the wound, the 360 beat the PS3 for the seventh straight week in Japan. At least Nintendo is only competing with itself for overall sales in Japan, with the Wii in first and the DS in second.<br />
