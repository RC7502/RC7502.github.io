So, this really doesn't have to do with video games, oddball comics or other geekery, but, I don't care.

It's nothing fancy; it is entirely adequate for getting from point A to point B.  It was the first brand new car we ever bought, and immediately upon purchasing it, I got the buyer's remorse.  So amazingly expensive.  But, we were DINKs, young and foolish, so what the heck, we got the car.
