Well, I played 3 games this week, it's sad now that I have homework and work and tons of other junk. The stereo is in the room now, we just don't have enough plugins for everything else yet so that's on hold. Our loft is redone and we find out if it gets approved tomorrow at 2pm. 
<br />

<br />
2 people got fired this week at work and it's quite disturbing. William Baker and John Billerman, two ITS staff workers got hosed this week b/c of budget problems.... riiight, nothing I can really do but pray...
<br />

<br />
I'm completely and utterly bogged down in between 2 jobs and schoolwork so that's all I got to say for this posting, see ya'll Tuesday.
<br />

<br />
btw, my boss and a few other coworkers will be attending <A HREF="http://www.novfa.org/temp/squidfest/temp/index.html">Squidfest</a> next weekend. It's an all night LAN party starting at 7pm and going till the next morn. Click the link for more details
