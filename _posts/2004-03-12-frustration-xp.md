Sit back and relax while you look at <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=390>this comic.</a>

I don't really hate Windows. Obviously it's so popular it must be the best. But what I really hate is my computer. I'm ready to make the switch over to Apple, and not just because all the <a href=http://www.devryguyz.com>cool kids</a> are doing it.

Before my computer problems I was going to talk about the new prime time cartoon Game Over. I might go into it in detail on Monday but the short review is that it sucked. Unfortunely there are no other comedies on TV so it'll probably be around for a few weeks. It's like that old saying, "in the land of no comedy, the one joke show is king." Now on the other hand, if the show gets better and I start to like it, it'll get cancelled instantly. Just look at Andy Richter or Firefly.  <Br><br><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20040312.gif' alt'' />
