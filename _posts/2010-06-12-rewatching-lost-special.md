We open on Walt's eye. Locke is teaching him how to throw a knife. Personally I don't see a problem with it. I was shooting guns and bows and arrows when I was his age. 

On the island: Walt runs away and gets attacked by a polar bear.
Off the island: Michael's baby mama took Walt and left, then died.

When this episode aired a popular theory was that Walt was special and could somehow summon animals. He was reading a comic book with a polar bear and one appeared. In the flashback he was reading a book on birds and a bird flew into the window. We never did get an answer and what made Walt so special. If you freeze on the polar bear attack you can see the Dharma logo brand. Also, at the end of the episode Charlie reads Claire's diary and she was dreaming about a black rock. Knowing that her privacy was being violated Claire wonders back into the camp at the end. 

Ashley's note: She liked that Walt's mom used to date Jack on Party of Five.
