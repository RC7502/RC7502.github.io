On to episode 2. This is a Kate episode. The flashback shows her living on a farm in Austraila until the farmer turned her in to the cops. On the island the marshal is dying and everyone wants to put him out of his misery because his constant yelling is really killing the mood. I think it's interesting that Jack doesn't want to restrain Kate when he finds out she is a criminal, and in season 6 Sawyer doesn't restrain Kate when she is running away at the airport. I guess its true that attractive people do get unfair treatment. The only sort of question that was raised is why Locke is so creepy but that'll get answered soon.

Ashley's note: she was glad Walt got his dog back.
