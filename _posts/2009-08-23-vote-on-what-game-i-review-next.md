I want to write more game reviews for Bitsmack, but I'm having a hard time deciding what game to play next. I made a list of all the games I have and it came out to about 330. I used a random number generator to pick 5 games from the list and now you can vote on what game I play next. Voting will be open for one week. Vote today or don't!
