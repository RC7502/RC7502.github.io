Mr. Eko was your typical African kid. Then some bad guys showed up and tried to make his brother shoot an old man. Eko stepped up and blew away the man without hesitating.

On the island: Charlie takes Mr. Eko to the plane full of drugs.
Off the island: The plane crashed on the island because of Eko. 

Now I'm no geography expert but how come everyone in the African scenes speak English? When they do Sun and Jin flashbacks everything is in Korean. We get to see a lot of the smoke monster in this episode. It stares down Eko and we can see flashes of people in the smoke. 

Ashley's note: Eko, like Sayid, has had a very messed up life.
