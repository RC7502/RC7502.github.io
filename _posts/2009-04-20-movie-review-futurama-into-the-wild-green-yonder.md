It is too focused on action and adventure and has lost touch with being funny. Don't get me wrong I love the Futurama series. I think that by setting a cartoon in the future it could take the idiosyncrasies of current society and exaggerate them to a hilarious degree. I also think it had a strong ensemble of characters that were all funny in their own way. So as I write this review I do love Futurama and I want to love this movie, but it's only ok.

In Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder, Amy's dad is trying to bulldoze the galaxy to build a giant miniature golf course. Leela joins up with some feminist environmentalists to try and stop him. Then Fry gets the ability to read peoples minds and is drafted into a secret society with their own agenda. The rest of the characters are pushed aside in this one. There are a lot of chases and fight scenes, and a supposed "mystery", part of which never even gets fully explained at the end. But where are the jokes? 

I would love to see Futurama come back as a series. I think it is hilarious at 22 minutes. Trying to spread it out to a movie every year is just too long. I give this movie a solid 3.

4 = own it
3 = rent it
2 = watch it on tv while doing other things
1 = watch it just to make fun of how terrible it is
0 = never watch under any circumstances no matter how curious you are
