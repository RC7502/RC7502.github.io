Inspired by <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/10/alt-text-cult/">this article</a> Goz and I have been talking about how you could save a lot of money on video games if you only bought games that were at least 2 years old. It's not like a video game has an expiration date on it. A game that earned high review scores 2 years ago plays exactly the same now as it did back then, except now it's 1/3rd the price. Another advantage to waiting is that the most popular games will usually release a "game of the year" or "collectors edition" later that includes all the extra downloadable content. If you think 2 years is a long time here are some examples of games that came out 2 years ago this week:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EYUQTQ?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001EYUQTQ">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001EYUQTQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> $27.50 (that's right, instead of buying Modern Warfare 2 this week you could get the first one for less than half the price!)
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELJFGO?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ELJFGO">Assassin's Creed</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001ELJFGO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> $14.52
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ9QVI?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FQ9QVI">Super Mario Galaxy</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000FQ9QVI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> $27.99

Those are some pretty sweet games for pretty low prices. But what if you want to go even farther back. Let's see what games came out 3 years ago this week:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELJDW0?ie=UTF8&tag=bitsmack-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ELJDW0">Gears of War</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bitsmack-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B001ELJDW0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> $7.37

As you can see, waiting 2 or 3 years and buying used can save you considerable money. These are all current generation games so its not even like you have to dust off your Dreamcast or anything. So who's with me to join The League of Extraordinarily Frugal Gamers? (possible name change to come)
