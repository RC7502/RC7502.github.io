After releasing the Sims and several expansion packs for it, Maxis is making The Sims 2. It will have a new graphics and lighting engine.
<br />
On this sequel your Sims are born, age, and die. The original Sims was a great game. I think it sold more copies than any other computer game made. 
<br />
This sequel might just kick ass. It's coming out this spring.
