<a href=/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=39>Part 4</a> is the second time since the start of the comic that kruton has been hit on the head with a shovel. If you have no idea what is going on read the comic from the beginning, well not the very beginning, those kinda suck. 
<br />
<br />
Dispite kruton's streak of video game wins I haven't been playing anything this week. Instead I have been watching The Simpsons Season 2 DVD. Season 2 is so much better than the first, but not quite as good as the third season. Goz and I call this "the golden season." <br />
<br />
Next week is my last week before I trade in my freedom for the shackles of undergraduate education. I tried to trade in my freedom at Software Etc. for store credit but they wouldn't give me enough money to buy Kabuki Warriors. Since school is starting up again I am only going to be able to post new comics on Mon, Wed and Fri.

One last note, if you haven't tried Vanilla Coke yet, it is awesome. I don't really like regular Coke, and I don't really like Vanilla Ice, but put the two together and you have a tasty drink. <br /><br /><!--more--><img src='http://dl.bitsmack.com/comics/20020815.gif' alt'' />
