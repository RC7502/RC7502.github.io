Hello ALL! 
<br />
Guess what!! I'm no longer grounded to the confines of my room anymore since Vice City has let go of it's unrestraining grip as my hands can finally let go of the controller. I finally beat Vice City, the game that beat up my copy of Kingdom Hearts and danced the night away on my DDRMAX game until it shattered so I could only play it.

So yea, the next DDR tourney and the next Squidfest are coming up this Saturday!!! I'm so excited cause now I can say I beat Vice City!! I hope to see you all there.

Billster and Angie were at the arcade tonight and we had a little rundown of our new skillz and I have very much regressed :(
<br />
Sadly, I have low hopes for winning this tourney.
<br />

<br />
Well keep watching, I'm back for now. If only the games I buy could play themselves, yeah then I'd be set ;)
<br />

<br />
Lata all,
<br />
