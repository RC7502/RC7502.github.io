On Monday, October 23, the iPod turns  five. To celebrate the occasion, I found on Youtube video of the introduction of the iPod:

And <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/">here is an interview</a> with Steve Jobs on his reflections on the iPod and its place in society.

I still have a 1st generation iPod, and besides the fact that I have had to replace the battery, it has been working great. Apple has really come a long way in 5 years. OS X has reached version 10.4, and the iPod in combination with the iTunes Store has taken over a majority of the online music sales. <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=497290">Apple's market share is now at 6.1%</a>, and the "Apple is dying" mantra hasn't been heard of in a long time. In fact<a href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/11274/">, 45% of students purchasing through the Princeton bookstore are now buying Macintoshes</a>.

Next year will be interesting to see how Apple fares against the release of Microsoft Vista, although I think the Bitsmack readers will be too busy playing with the Wii to care.
