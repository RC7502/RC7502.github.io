Spike TV, in all it's enigmatic glory, presented their videogame award show Sunday evening. Although the network gained points from me for airing both Predator movies in the afternoon (I don't understand why they showed Predator 2 and then Predator) the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/12/10/spiketvs-2007-video-game-awards-are-either-utterly-obvious-or-extremely-strange" title="SpikeTV's 2007 Video Game Awards: extremely strange">award show appears to be as crappy as ever</a>.
<p>Did anyone watch it that wants to admit to it and comment?</p>
