Hey, here's a <a href=http://www.bitsmack.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Comics&file=index&action=comic&id=423>comic.</a>
<br />

<br />
Saturday we had a party for Brad and Will graduating. There were like a bunch of Devry people there plus K-Dog, Cassadi, AJ, Megan and her friend Crystal. It was a really good time. 
<br />

<br />
Next week I head to Lakeside for my 10th year. Which means I'm going to need some guest comics. If you think you have what it takes to entertain a bunch of geeks send your comic to guestcomics@bitsmack.com.<Br><br><!--more--><img src='/wp/wp-content/comics/20040622.png' alt'' />
