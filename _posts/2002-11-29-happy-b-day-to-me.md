I didn't get a comic done for today for 3 reasons:
<br />
1. Yesterday was Thanksgiving
<br />
2. Today is my birthday
<br />
3. I forgot
<br />

<br />
I hope this doesn't rock your feable clerk world as I know most of you will either be out of town or shopping or eating or sleeping or heck... I really don't know what you're doing. What you should be doing is partying with me. Speaking of which, I should really get back to that.
