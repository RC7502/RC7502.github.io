As the legend goes a boy is after the Triforce of Power. Yes I am reffering to Zelda The Wind Waker. Instead of an Ocarana you have a Wand. Link is also quite animated in his actions, and speech. If you thought this game was gay comere a minute and I'll teach you otherwise. My GC is not here so I haven't been playing but I let my neighbor borrow it and play so I could watch.

In other news I got the LAST GBASP Cobalt (blue) from Wal-mart and got me a copy of Mega Man Battle Network. The game is sweet!! It's a Mega Man RPG!!
<br />

<br />
Also in living news, I am in the market for a house here in the Findlay area. So far we have seen 2 houses and one seems awesome! I hope to have something picked out by next month since I'll be moving in early May.

I think I may be the only person calling Software Etc and asking but WHEN in State of Emergency coming out for Xbox!!! I want to be able to play multiplayer against my friends. Also, if anyone has my copy of SoE for PS2 please let me know b/c I can't find it.

Finally as RC hinted at, I'm also in the market for a new PC, not b/c mine isn't good enough but I wrenched my back and was sore the entire week b/c I carried ALL my stuff from my dorm room to my car in 2 trips. Also what RC meant about Dell being cheap was, it's even EASIER to buy a case, motherboard and power suppoly already in a plug in everything else and that anyone could get an even better deal than Dell! Also as I am looking for extra cash I will start building systems for people or installing parts for a small fee. K-dogg need cash badly!! That's all for this edition!

K-dogg out!!
